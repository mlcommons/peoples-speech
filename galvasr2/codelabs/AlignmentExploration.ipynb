Podium not sure which it is will be followed by Guerrero Good morning members and morning Mr White I'm here to testify about the open space money fund. We. Worked with kids for about eighteen years. That I leased from A and B. And the last ten years was. We're concerned with developments over there so we would like to see a little space saved for. That area and. I kind of know the place inside and out I've been down there for eighteen years so any one of you guys want to ever come down there or if you guys ever want to know about that area I'll be glad to show you guys I have documentation of. When they came in that day when they come in the shoreline I have documentation of the nanny . And. It's so sad to see that you know I live in. A part time resident. So much rubbish people there I think for eighteen years that's all they did was take it up lease and pick up the rubbish I mean shame on you guys who leave the rubbish me and my kids the kids program that's all we do. Farms and pickup are obvious that's why people complain about Gates the gates are there. We're just tied up because of rubbish so we want some open space money so we can save some place where we're not going to see rubbish. Like I said. Also testifying for the union. We've got some land and we want to share it with the people with with the people. I'm willing to. Make some community gardens for them and. We just need some open space some open space land that's what we need up in because the nearest If we don't get or we don't have that the nearest public access can be Hanum one so look at the distance from. Go on I'm on everything is private property everything is privately owned We have no access to base so if a car or somebody someplace is not open space to look at that we don't have to travel to get down to public access so thanks for your time and thank you for letting me speak thank you very much for being here this morning members questions such as fire. Thank you Mr Chair Thank you Mr Bodie for being here. I was looking at the property that they were suggesting we get and so long it goes from the highway basically all the way down to the bay versus. Across the bay What if the community had you know I'm not asking you to represent the community but if if there was a choice would there be something long and. Along the ocean with some access or just the one narrow. There's a couple lots because it's all subdivided already in subdivision approval has been approved there's there's the jars portion it's about one hundred twenty five acres and that's jaws I think that develops offered some land to the colony and I don't know what's happening with that and then there's there's a lot. If you look at the map there's a lot three and four on the side of. The So those are portions and then a lot lot lot to sold already. So you know there's areas that can be bought you know so we just have to look at it but what I would suggest is we just put a kitty to put some money in the kitty and to study and see and survey and see if it's feasible or if it's possible for store choir to land. And Lot one is the. OK THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Any other questions for instance. Thank you for being here this morning thank you. Followed but it Jane. If I got that right. Morning and happy. I am currently president of the heritage hall. I have come before you again asking that we reconsider the amount. That. Has. Offered to us we were looking for six hundred thousand and the six hundred thousand is only to cover a changeover that. Fire department has put upon us. That was down just one. We are asking you for six hundred thousand we're asking the state for another three hundred thousand nine hundred thousand is just for changeovers changeovers that we didn't see as. We didn't see the changeover we did see that we needed it the fire department says that we need a fire hydrant we didn't think we needed it in not only the fire do we have to trench two times so we thought we had enough money to do everything and we had a little bit extra and just a hundred thousand is just taking everything that we. Could bring us up to what we need for right now and that's all I'm asking for I don't want to have to talk to you and. That's it conclude your testimony thank you letters any questions risk girl.

And Mr Mina will be followed by Simon Russell. Morning chair Good morning live. My submitted testimony this morning so I don't think it's been in your in front of you guys so a couple of my for being late so I'll just read the testimony that I submitted if that's OK. As president of our state wide growing organization whose mission is to advocate for the sovereign right of farmers ranchers and fishers to create and sustain vibrant and prosperous agricultural communities for the benefit of all Hawaii I ask for your consideration of the following items put forth by councilwoman Cochran. H F U U S A chapter of the National Farmers Union one hundred thirteen year old farming organization we currently have six hundred plus members being in our fifth year of development with eight chapters across the state we have one in quite a while who two on Maui and four on the big island. Item one is a provision for twenty thousand dollars for Hawaii farmers union united to Maui chapters Holly. Chapter. From the agricultural promotional grant under the economic development program to continue the farm a princess mentoring program that's basically to get old guys like me to be able to share our knowledge with the young passionate farmers so they can become farmers. To a provision for thirty five thousand dollars for the wife and farmers united to Maui chapters Hollyhock Lamont Hill of West Maui to hire a grant writer that can assists H.F. U.U. With financial independence and forwarding our mission. Our organization stands for education legislation and cooperation in the development of family farms. That value and utilize regenerative farming practices and restoring the vitality of the land in the production of locally grown food fuel and fiber we envision an agricultural system in a way that empowers those who have a passion to farm it may not have the wherewithal to do so. Either due to high costs of or access to land and other infrastructural obstacles an expression that passion in making a living and raising a family by farming we have served that is through the development of a resilient culture of a multitude of family farms providing a consistent and diverse supply of locally produced food that we will see a shift in the amount of food production produced locally so off sent the whole set the amount imported to our local economy thank you for consideration in this matter thank you it was the media members questions that us for this Cochran I think it's fair and good morning Mr mean if Thank you for being here you know you meant. Thirty five for grant writer is that for the organization as a whole or for just the one Mona column by chapter no would be for both Maui chapters so highly alkali chapter and Mona column by chapter and so currently you have none not currently we have none Yes And is there are. Certain grants that you folks are looking to go for and perhaps potential money to be yes we were basically looking in our development forward we are creating pieces of the puzzle of an whole system of agriculture nutrient recycling center the family farm Apprentice mentoring program. Specialty crops rats around. Supporting our biological practices that we want to implement OK OK thank you very much for coming to thank you Terry. Yes Mr Goodman thank you Mr A for being here I know that in my proposal for the the chairs Mr O'Connor was consideration I put in fifty thousand for the farm mentoring program so I was unaware of the additional. Amount of monies that were you that you had mentioned and considered regarding the grant writer so are you seeing that the grant writer is not connected to the mentoring farm Mentoring Program Well my understanding that the farm mentoring Grant was the twenty thousand dollars grant that you folks put forward and that's a thirty five thousand was the whole money for the ground writer and I may be you know I'm just the president of the organization I may be wrong. In the spirit that there's there's people on the ground within the local chapters that I've been working on this and so there's been a lot of. Maneuvering in a sense to be able to support what it is we want to have forward so if I am an accurate I know our legislative chair is right behind me can clear up any any question around that. If if we could clarify that because it's my understanding was fifty thousand for the farm mentoring program and that's basically my focus but I'd like to get more of a clear understand you know some of the breakdown as you know thank you for bringing that out you know absolutely. This bill. Good morning. I appreciate. Your organizations efforts to start growing farmers because that's what I'm hearing we really need I armories. Does your. Crop. Growing our teachings a voice last mentoring. Just on our gadget farming. You know we support we support farmers ability to grow food. To articulate it better. We want to lower inputs for farmers and we want to feel we want our yields to be raised and without leaving this D. Environment behind in any way that they can't do that again you know it's a build resiliency we. Support conventional farmers who basically are pointed in the direction of regenerating their lands you know that's the practices that we value in our organization and and so. But we're not our organization isn't part of our privy to making any of farming. Operation that's legal in the United States wrong we just want to be good at what we do and support the farmers who value what we do I appreciate that thank you thank you thank you any further questions for Mr Mina. Tina thank you for being here this morning thank you very want to live in Mr Russell be followed by Whitford Good morning Mr Chairman honorable council members Thanks for taking my testimony request that it be submitted for the record if it's on the record. I did some of it around one AM last night is probably you know channeling your guys' energy or something because it's but it's a been a long week. I'm submitting this testimony in strong support of Councilman Cochran and provisos the two provisos in your budget councilwoman thank you so much for for working with us and specifically with the President Robinson from the holly a chapter and if there is any confusion about amounts of money she's definitely one to talk to because the information I have right here talks about a twenty thousand dollars proviso for the farmer Apprentice mentoring which has been talked about for quite some time amongst the chapter and just for transparency I should say Simon Russell vice pres of the state white farmers union I'm also a member of the board of the farmers union which is east so the two chapters are east and west. And also the state legislative chairman so I oversee all interactions between the union and the legislature and the Department of Agriculture also. So it's exciting for me growing as quickly as we are and so things can fall through the cracks and if there is any confusion about amounts of money I sincerely apologize so the first. Proviso that I'm in strong support of. Is the farmer apprenticed mentoring and it should be noted that the farmers union here in has around four hundred members it's three hundred plus a lot and month to month the membership goes up and down because people don't renew and they renew and so and so forth but we're growing it started with three people it was. Vincent. And Bill Greenleaf and some and. Mr Goldstein has his first name is Gave Me I'm sorry but there were three now there's over almost four hundred so that was five years ago that we started up in. And now we're more crowding out the community center and we can barely fit in there so it's great that so many people interested in local agriculture. The second item I'm really interested in supporting and I'm in strong support of is for a grant writer for this. The MAOI chapters because they're growing so fast we're all volunteers we calculated recently there's ten thousand hours of volunteer time going into this organization and it takes a lot of coordination and that coordination can be very time consuming so we want grant writers for to build organizational capacity and there's a beginning farmer rancher development program coming our way through our grant writer right now who is Phyllis Robinson So that's exciting that's about three hundred thirty thousand dollars that's going to come in to Maui to train these young farmers under the farmer Apprentice mentoring program and it's in collaboration I might add with the Kohala center on the big island so it's it's resembling a statewide program but it's going to be centered here in Mali so you'll have one concluding comment please. Just for taking the time to work to consider working with us and building our agriculture sector because as we keep hearing we need to grow farmers and that's what I do thank you Mr Simon Mr Russell I'm sorry just for everybody's. Knowledge we need to stick to the three minutes this morning we've got a lot of testimony we want to hear from everyone who's here members any questions for Mr Russell seen none thank you very much thank you for your time and this word for it will be followed by. Good morning chair and members of the council My name is Rita Whitford and I'm here to speak on behalf of my husband. And myself who are riders of the paratransit bus. We are against the. Proposed a rise or raise in the fees for the bus riders for the bus passes when I saw that the bus pass was going it's proposed to go from forty five dollars up to sixty dollars I thought. That's a couple of meals that somebody could be affording it's their medication that perhaps they need or it's help paying their rent or their utilities and I just feel like. This should not be done at this time and when I saw that the chance to ride was going from two dollars to three dollars for just one ride I thought sure it doesn't sound like much but one dollar can add up in many different ways for example if you've got a beloved cat or dog a dollar can buy dog food cat food for your head which makes your life much more enjoy a ball so I would say that. Yes I am very much against raising the bus fares for the people who can least afford to have a bus fare. Increase with upon them because in most cases we're all on a fixed income so it just it's not it's not right and. In the old days where we would say and there's a P.S. To that are now you'd say B T W I would say if you're going to raise the bus fare then you better fix the service on the bus that's it for me thank you very much for the question just for. Oh I'm sorry I missed by so yes chair and think you miss which part for being here this morning I know what transportation means to folks but I do have a question proposal that we've talked about a little bit is some kind of an income qualification do you think that you could live with that you know instead of everybody being given it would you be buying into the idea of us having to verify income and probably contracting with an agency like that to do that it's an interesting thought I hadn't even thought about that. So many things are based on your income nowadays so I don't at this point I don't know but you know what we're trying to do of course is to find a way to take care of the people that really need this and we don't want to hurt them nobody wants to hurt people that are struggling right now but some of the people who might be able to afford it and if they can we sure want to take care of the people that really need it so that's why it becomes an idea it is an idea and I would certainly think about it then perhaps show up with another meeting and discuss that again OK seem to keep coming up when it's about these busts issues but it is a business you know and thank you for coming because we need to hear from the people that use it thank you thank you for the further questions for the test for members seem done thank you miss for being here this morning. Mr. Joyce COA Cami. And following the score coming to us money we will go to our district offices to check again please proceed with really good morning council members and staff My name is.

That opened about a year ago or to be a year in June. Since opening the bike park we have had about five hundred people buy season passes from all sides of the island Also since the two years that I've been working with the state and local forest we've seen the use and the demand for that area rapidly increase we've had to double the parking lot size and every weekend you go up there you see the parking lot just totally packed lots of people really want and need that time to get out. These lands on the side. Are already fairly used. Lots of people going down there and these type of projects are very important for this expanding population and this community that needs and wants open space access to trails and coastal access that's all it thank you very much thank you very much misquoting members questions for the fire. Thank you for being here this morning and Mr Kos will be followed by Stephen for so good morning and thanks for the mammoth job you doing. When I was Laurence COSTELLO The White look at a block from here. I would like to fish and we provide three testimonies one in support of the wine Farmers Union requests they listed were earlier of the two provisions supporting the Farmers Union the council member Cochran inserted in her own budget proposal who. Provision for the twenty thousand for the agricultural Grant apprenticeship training program. The thirty five thousand for the Maui chapter of a higher grant writer one to support those. In behalf of the shock of movement requests for two. Ensure that the fifty thousand dollars presently a lot of peer review of the impact of G M O's is locally applied and third is in behalf of the county's commitment to sustainability. I'm asking to ask the Council to approve and fund I should use my glasses a proven fund a division of Environmental Protection of sustainability proposal is supported by the two thousand and twelve charter amendment and also to reinstate and fund the two thousand and thirteen budget approved position for sustainability coordinator basically suggesting of truly committed to sustainability which I. Hope and sure it is but that's. You know that's a baseline. In support of that I've produced two documents one that I have actually sent to electronically through B. Of one one is titled citizens calling for a truly panel twenty fifteen now we counted ministration and in their fund I have some background in terms of sustainability dating back to ninety six when the concept became popular. Pates five years sustainability sufficient and I just like to read the first two sentences very quickly the term itself seemed poorly understood often than it plated and profoundly inadequate who gets to be sustainable one might ask is it is it the top one percent or the point one percent of the top one percent noting that one seventh of humanity with a similar ratio of my always residents would consider their lives sustainable given a single meal and a safe place to sleep is a sufficient So I think we are a whole notion of what sustainable needs some review on page seven to listen issues that do not serve Miley's whole community wellbeing and I shifted from sustainability told whole community wellbeing and so for there's a focus. And principly on page eight. He's planning permits for twenty fifteen and when we add those up we look at those totals come to seventeen thousand nine hundred eleven units four hundred fifty thousand above I'm told that will produce forty thousand eight hundred thirty seven more cars I don't know where we're going to do it but we're going to do that many cars two hundred four tons of annual carbon emissions. And it will raise as always be population by thirty percent thank you testimony thank you that's been provided questions for Mr cos. I see none thank you I mean they look very good and Mr will be followed by Harry Asuncion. Chairman White and council members My name is Steve and I live in Pioneer I am speaking against a twenty five thousand dollars budget proposal for a joint fact finding group on the G.M.O. Fields his proposal proposal provides no testing at all and cannot further or address the environmental safety issues around the G.M.O. Test fields that were addressed by the voters in passing the G.M.O. Moratorium initiative we need disclosure of the amounts of pesticides use used and we need environmental safety and toxicology studies conducted by independent scientists who quite possibly have the highest levels of eight. Am a trend and Clora. Anywhere in the world citizens are concerned about their health. I am personally working on a project to do pesticide testing beehives and honey I have initiated a Citizen's Petition to the county of Council to authorize a fifteen thousand dollars grant for be and Heinie testing for pesticides this is an alternative to the proposed Fact-Finding group and is a direct and simple way of beginning pesticide drift testing the idea came from a grant by the co-op you can't County Council in May of two thousand and fourteen there is widespread concern about the health and safety of bees. And about the potential glyphosate levels in honey One beekeeper twenty two four hives within eight months one and a half miles downwind of the canal on the road Monsanto fields and on November third two thousand and fourteen I collected ninety five. B.S. In the same area. Beach one of the tests would be done for pesticide stored in pollen in the hive and the honey would be tested for life for sayed I have collected four hundred fifty signatures so far. I've taken six weeks off but. I'm ready to go online thank you very much Mr We're going to have one more finished one sentence we have your testimony and we have copies of your testimony I believe.

Executive director for community work a program now doing business as. We.

Collection events that he created for the Westside who support the collection and hauling off recyclable materials such as cardboard plastic glass paper and high fiber redeemable cans and bottles as well as scrap metal supply incessantly cycling items I have done my homework and I have already obtained a verbal commitment from the folks at the line to carry Mall for us to host these events on their property I have also met with sunset with Terence and they stablish a gainful partnership that would assist us in our efforts to provide the West my residents this much needed service we have an ongoing relationship with him our disposal.

Thank you for being here this morning thank you and thanks rumor . It's gross movie followed by Oh it could be career good or. Good morning Chairman why Maui County Council members I first would like to say I've been watching you and I really appreciate how attentive you are to all the testifiers Thank you. My name is Pamela Grossman a haiku resident and I am in support of the heritage quarter proposal at P.R. I have had the blessing to live just steps away from this location for the past twenty seven years and I have seen so many changes in haiku my children were raised there and now my grandchildren are being raised there we have walked run ridden our horses laughed and cried on these lands it's been our home our front yard if you will and not just for us but for our neighbors as well. It is a sacred place for so many of us the beauty the open space and just looking at the ocean of one of is one of God's greatest gifts to us there are very few places like this left on the planet and you have it in your hands to save it I am deeply concerned about the potential housing development considering Maui's fragile state regarding water and water meters our family has been waiting over twenty years or more for a water meter and so have my neighbors therefore I can only deduce that Wells would be dug tapping into our already diminishing aquifer we cannot afford this we can also speak about P.R. He's beauty all day long but if saved what should be done with it you ask I suggest a volunteer committee be formed with the high Q. Community sceptically designated for this piece of land its preservation its beauty and safety should all be considered. Long before surfers were a part of Jaws the terrain of this area has been always precarious now with the influx of the big wave surfer you know Jaws thousands of people are coming to see the amazing and spectacular waves and those brave enough to write them if we can properly create a safe experience for all those wanting to see it then there should be reasonable fees charged earmarked to help maintain the land and generate additional revenue to help preserve more open spaces on the north shore we must come up with creative ideas even perhaps making it a community park so everyone could enjoy it and still maintain the beauty of the ajna thank you thank you very much Mr Grossman questions for the test for. Thank you for your testimony this morning Mr. Grossman. County Council. And I'm in favor of the proposed budget that would purchase the and it draws jobs are important to me because I've lived next door to the end as long as I can remember all the generations after me must be able to enjoy the beauty of the waves and the water. My memories are here and I don't want them to be built on it and if the land is built on the land it's natural beauty. The generations after me will not be able to experience the natural beauty. Now he has brought from around the world they come here because it stands. It is different it is different from anything they have ever seen the waves. And surrounding area give it a feeling of adventure so people can enjoy the wilderness and not another neighborhood. So there is no trash over the place my point. Generations are now in the world can experience the view for as long as we live. Thank you very much give you any questions for the test fire Mr COUCH Thank you Mr Chair and thank you for being here and that's very good testimony and thank you for having the courage to come up and speak with us thank you so you live in the area yes and you go down through there a lot. OK. Right now there are a lot of trash and stuff that people throw or people being we had to testify before say that there was a lot of trash Yeah still still it's a little bit OK. All right thank you thank you thank you. And. Mr Grossman followed by Andrea Bachman. My name is that Grossman and I support the Heritage Corridor I was born and raised on the North Shore jaws to be specific My dad used to take me fishing and horseback riding to Jaws look out to watch the waves and catch fish before anybody knew that it would be home to one of the biggest surfing waves in the world could also take me fishing to another spot located near the river known as grass bulls or tiger Island which is about a half a mile maybe a mile going towards Oceanside and somebody bought the property we're not no longer able to face about spot they put up gates and pillars to keep everybody. Places gated he still allows us to use his ocean access he has a phone number on his gate you can call him. You know I'm older I have many nieces and nephews and I like to take them into fun go fishing and do other outdoor activities the same activities I did as a child when I was their age this is going to be one of the last places in the north shore with their. Bikes and the other things that this place gets taken away and get the chance to teach this next generation my parents taught me it's also known as a historic area. And I don't want that to get destroyed I believe a park could possibly benefit the community. The local people the terrorists maybe charge a fee. Or possibly from people dumping more rubbish in there. Maybe can be farmed out is doing his place I just want to see it taken away and I thank you for listening thank you Mr Grossman the questions for the test fire. Grow up in a wonderful part of the Island thank you for being here this morning thank you. Buckman will be followed by a. Hundred bucks. Or you. Are you via OK. Callie one more time for Andrea Bachman are. OK. Good morning good morning. I work for the. Restoration partners and the project coordinator I want to. Let you know that we work with public and private landowners to protect interests. Thank you. Because they contain critical valuable cultural water biological and even economic resources that are key components for our communities and for futures we've received Department of Water Supply funding and office of economic development funding in the past and county funding has been critical for us more able to leverage it often on a one to four five basis and this foundational support provided by the county is enabled our projects to grow we've been able to engage with so for more of our landowners we've gotten thousands more acres of area fenced and protected in recent years thousands more native trees planted hundreds more volunteers and students brought up into the mountain to connect with the forest and the species and the ecosystems up there as well as the culture resources. I just want to let you know also that were a science based organization we're doing research that is providing compelling evidence showing that restarting degraded areas does in fact help recharge the awkward for an increased amount of water that's going deeper into the deeper into the awkward further and at a. More rapid rate than degraded areas or pasture land that's now remaining out there so I know that. It's an investment and restoring degraded ecosystems is costly and you won't see the benefits as far as water probably for decades however something about our partnership that's really important is that there are all these other facets to restoration including the community benefits I've seen student volunteers come up and you know from trouble of use to. Just students seeking seeking knowledge and information they meet one of our our field crew members and their eyes light up and they get inspired I've seen those students. And then come back and work professionally in waterside conservation So what you said Pretty isn't just about economy or water it's about community and culture as well and it's really important and I appreciate your passing continued support Thank you Mr Bookman course and so the test for thank you for being here this morning. And Mr. D'Amato will be followed by you know when money. Good morning council chair and council members morning time is Vendome Alonso and I'm here for the preservation of the land for along the North Shore I believe the my call to counts you should purchase a line is so that there could be public access for a family to spend time together to watch the surf and for surfers that want to go to Jaws. Also keeping these lines would enable the opportunity to preserve these lines and keep its natural beauty and not to the hands of business businesses that can construct buildings and this choice its natural beauty one of my classmates suggests that there should be purchases that store that public access could bring families to watch. Surfers surf jaws and another body and student was arguing that the should be kept because it would be a great opportunity for having open spaces for the people to enjoy and if these lands are gone these would affect many people and a locos pool would have access to announce my fellow friend Brennan who is a lucky who wasn't able to attend today's has a testimony. And he say's that the North Shore a rich place full of mana and history and arrow that holds the richest fishing grounds and the most crazy surf breaks how can we let developers develop this in the proposal the land from. A two dollars as a for so by the A and B. This part of that includes many ancient Hawaiian history historical sites including the engine hope. Holidays and all the ease that my coastal land trust exists here and not just to save lives from developers but to preserve the land the things this organization do for the community it's a great one in the books and I feel this section of land should be in the hands of them and the people of Mali not in the hands of developers looking to ruin our home me and my Ohana have been fishing and surfing and utilizing this area for many many years and I cannot let people bid on this line and all the actions locos and all the actions for locals to be taken away from us you may say that the right of ways will be made but it is not the same no one wants to go fishing in front of someone's houses or having to ask permission to fish in front of the fish in a spot that requires no permission before I have seen many of my favorite fishing spots be blocked off by homes how do you think that makes me feel being told I cannot fish in my spot that I basically grew up on please take this but please take this to mind our fishing general our future generations deserve a chance to utilize a lot just as how I have and how the past generations before me thank you thank you very much for it's a small Me and the questions members. Thank you for being here and keeping. The spring money with Tyler toward more good morning good morning hi my name's Nina magnetic and I'm a senior in high school. I grew up on Big Island and as you can probably tell I had a huge culture shock I literally gripped probably the middle of a rain forest and I came here and noticed all the suburbs. It was crazy I couldn't think that anyone would tear down forests and stuff and build houses when there's perfectly good houses are ready. I support. I support keeping the coastlines fronting the surf break open for all to enjoy and for the support the county acquisition from its open space preservation fun as three hundred acres from. To Kona new in Perth for present and future generations to enjoy. If you think about it if they were to develop this land and turn it into something like a condo or another golf course which we have tons of already how many times a day or how many times a week would you every think about renting a condo or going to play around to go how many of you know and not all right exactly so locals generally can't afford to go and write condos can't afford to go play around the Gulf how would this be helpful to us to our community it went right so that's why I think it should be preserved for future generations like Bode is doing he's using his spot to grow. He's using it to girl plants. We could do the same thing there we could help our community by growing things there or we could turn into a public beach park or somewhere where families can go to enjoy and hang out serve fish something like that if there's one thing that all locals having common it's a beach but there's a difference between going to beach in front of someone else and going to a public beach park like pigs so please County think about it think about what you're doing each generation tearing down this land and probably destroying a bunch of native plants are over there you don't know what's over there what are they going to build more condos or golf courses. Can we afford to visit those places. So please think about it. Thank you thank you. To testify thank you very much for your presence Portman this being the any. More It will be followed by Katherine Knowlton. Hello my name is Tyler talking Maury I'm currently a senior H.P. Bought a nice school. And I heard about this topic on opening the land to the public along jobs in class I believe the opening another part will be amazing I think that sense we live here in Hawaii it's important to have many natural public parks in different parts of the island to show different aspects of our natural and I think having this particle make the line more rich in its natural beauty and it could also be another attraction like you know about earlier helical. For this land to be owned and open to the public because to go there and so on to take my family and. I think that this land ends up being sold to private owners fear the fact that we'll be able to access. And only people who are invited can go there and serve it . Fairly toes being built on this line because eventually a lot of our coastline will be developed. Like the thought of keeping our natural beauty here in Hawaii because that's make us all a thank you thank you thank for being here this morning and Catherine Middleton will be followed by John of a Sato. Good morning and thank you council I'm Kathy and I'm a school teacher and I'm also speaking in support of preserving the ocean land in the area and as an ocean steward I know that when you have a part you can actually do plantings and stuff to take care of the ocean instead of having private houses where you aren't in control of what's going on in the yard you're not in control of what's happening to the ocean. Students when they found out last week that there was a chance of preserving this park had a wide variety of comments they said things like I'd like to go watch the waves or take my family out there private owners might destroy that land another student said a lot of space has been built on Maui and they should be kept natural we would want to take up to make a park and keep Atlantis naturals it could be another student said I think it's really good idea people want an open space so another one said it's a good idea to buy the land to help the community and bring families out especially places with big open spaces and lots of different people to enjoy to protect the land it's a great opportunity to use this what land wisely people have had the wisdom to set the money aside the money is available the opportunity is now before it is gone to development thank you very much for considering purchasing this land for the preservation of our future family. I have also more hundred more thank you and be followed by. CREWS. Good morning share the morning counsel thank you for hearing my testimony I'm here on behalf of feed my sheep and the budget proposal for nine hundred thousand dollars for this program my name is John A subtle and I am a pastor at Grace Bible Church and. One of the passions that we have Grace Bible Church is to see the elimination of hunger on the island of Maui and with the limited budget. We choose really carefully where to give our money and feed my sheep you know after looking at different organizations feed my sheep has been the most efficient that we have seen the most efficient at distributing food to the poor and hungry on Maui and so we we personally give about fifteen hundred dollars a month to this organization and were group of collectively there's thirty other churches that support this this service tomorrow and. I know that there are so many things in front of you guys you know to to consider and giving money to and and whenever there's a new thing that comes on that it's easy to not give funds to that because it's new it's unheard of but this organization feed my sheep if you if you really take a look at it. The C.E.O. The president of the organization she doesn't get paid a cent and everything is volunteer and the ninety eight thousand dollars will go toward food it will go to our overhead expenses and all these other things it's money that will be spent feeding the people of Mali and we're very. You know we're at the place I believe percentage wise in all of the. Colony has come the closest to eliminating hunger and that's been with. For this organization feed my sheep they've never had any county funding before this is the first year that they've asked for county funding of ninety eight thousand dollars and that will go so far you know to help the people of Mali So thank you for considering putting that ninety eight thousand dollars back on the budget thank you thank you very much but questions for the test for. Procedure being here this morning Mr Cruz will be followed by Kerry. One in German and. Males program the rental program and the best program my name is Dominic This is my wire between our crews and we are asking you guys restore to one and back to two hundred and eight thousand for a rental program because I lost my job and my wife is only one working right now and director Paul Graham was on best doing it help us a lot being homeless. And I'd like to thank you guys for. Supporting the man the best program for giving me a lot of chance of getting my diploma and not going to college and helping me with my life. And looking forward to life for me and my family and I thank you guys for supporting this program and I am MALE Thank you for letting me just today thank you very much and also help me with my consuming credit. Thank you I mean if a saving us and without this program we wouldn't know where we want to know where would be so thank you very much stank obviously gets. Thank you very much members I think you are since the test fire thank you for being here this morning and. Will be followed by Helen Nielsen. Members we are reaching halfway mark. We'll take a break after two more test of our. THANK YOU morning chair respective Council mentors My name is Jerry Lum I'm the community services director for Emil and I'm here to testify on restoring the funding to three hundred eighty eight thousand for the rental assistance program when I started in two thousand and two the rental assistance program was called emergency rental assistance program basically it was a check no case management is handed out to the clients every year in April since then it is changed dramatically now we have four different partners within this program within the last seven years the grants manager and it asked for specific components from each one of us Emil had implemented the literacy class it's a three hour class it touches upon basic budgeting and also emphasizes two factors . That the budget has to be realistic and asked to be achievable I think the second biggest component is understanding critter scores and the M. Pack that it has on our clients' financial life. The purpose that they're here because they have fallen behind and we're trying to find out the root of the problem through this program we sit down we sit down with them did it diligently we go over their budget we look at their income and expenses worksheet and we also look in detail their monthly bank statements to see those obvious don't want that spending we have intensive case management and we structure up to six months of consulate or five thousand dollars which is the cap again this is shared among four agencies and just to give you an idea last year we had served over we had served ninety one clients or. One hundred forty percent of our and all go we help clients retain their homes ninety one percent of them retained their homes after last subsidized substance. As was provided so I think that's a good rate among the four agencies which includes. Women helping women and family life center we have seen two hundred eighty five clients because we work collaboratively we share information such as the client database. From there we can determine if any how many clients are coming in to seek assistance elsewhere this minimizes duplications of services and we are proud to say the last year we serve only to duplicating services and the only reason for that is that is the fact that when clients come in they come in with a different name sometimes the client will come in as the husband and the wife will come in with a different surname and. We were unable to catch that mistake again I asked whether restore the restoration of three hundred and eight thousand dollars and five hundred for the rental program. Thank you very much Mr. Spicer thank you very much Jerry and thank you Mr Long for being here and thank you for a great Graham just one question you told us but you served Do you have a waiting list at this time we have no waiting lists. Like you said among the four agencies we've been able to do that to have people come in and it takes approximately seven to ten working days for us to process requisition for rental assistance but you're able to handle what's coming we are able to handle what's coming in despite the low inventory and the increase in rentals that low inventory is not a factor it is a big factor because families are not moving from where they are which is sometimes in violation of their lease agreement but it it it has been a big factor within the last year have you seen that need increase question definitely the reason I'm asking you these questions is we're trying to increase the funding Yes and if we're going to increase it I want to make sure that you know we can handle the need is is different and they're OK thank you very much you're welcome. Thank you Mr Chairman thank you for being here you mentioned that there are four agencies that work together that's correct Are there other agencies that I guess the chair of the committee had this question last night and just wanted to find out are there other agencies that could also join that group or are you the four that provide the service on the. Couple years we had extended invitations to Salvation Army and Catholic charities. So nobody's come and asked and nobody has come in as thank you. Thank you very much for. And Miss Nielsen is the next testifier and fall in Miss Nielsen testimony we will take a ten minute morning break. Good morning chair removed morning council members Happy May Day My name is Helen Nielsen and was asked to come here today to give testimony on behalf of Ted Clement who is the executive director of the Hawaiian Islands Land Trust. HIMES to many testimony in support of the proposal from council member Guzman to use three point two million of the county open space fund to support the protection of the property and in the north on the North Shore the Hawaiian Islands Land Trust has identified that North Shore area as an iconic area worthy of conservation and we stand ready and willing to work with you to protect available properties in that area with perpetual conservation easements and other collaboration's he goes on to talk about how great the organization is but you already know that and I would like to provide my own personal testimony I'm out of breath I don't know why. I'm in full support of this project and I really think the council member Guzman for putting forth the proposal . I don't know if you're aware that a number of years ago the Maui coastal land trust did a survey with the planning department and interviewed people up and down this coast and it was clearly. A big issue for everyone to support as much of the shoreline as possible especially in light of so much of it disappearing and I'm so proud to see so many young people come up and testify. OK The next issue I'll have three minutes I'd like to give my support for. Your favor development agencies proposals for the infrastructure and the clean and safe programs in. You know all these things tying together let's. Let's get some formal housing. Let's keep. Available the work that has been doing. Over the years you know it really gives them a purpose and to find their place in the future and I think all of this is a good thing for our community as a whole so I appreciate once again the opportunity to testify and thanks for all you do I know it's not easy to get US News and questions to the test fire. Thank you for being here this morning thanks members and after the break. I will be asking if you have any questions because we've just gotten about six more testifiers signed up so after the break please let me know that you have a question if you do and for our district offices if you have any testifiers come in please e-mail the staff so we'll know to come back to you otherwise we will be coming back to the district offices until we until the end of the. Testimony period so with that members. Think I'd like to cut the break to about five minutes of thought is workable for you and we'll be in recess until ten forty. Time Mr Hawley if you have a test fire please e-mail the staff we were in the midst of. You're going to you're going to lose your chance to go to hollow again Mr Foley. Walking. Alone Happy May Day My name is Justin Costa. I'm going to read this excuse me so that I don't miss any points and I'd like to explain this display here in front of me. I am the representative for Homik or law I have lived in a McCall all for over fifty years more particular haikus our shores stretches from Monday called Gulch whom we share with him a call. To he a border NG The McCool of Cornwall where I have generational Tiny's in my capacity as a representative My position is to find alternative ways to protect our resources as an arm of the department of land and natural resources by way of F. Two one two and I to aid I humbly recommended requests that the chair moved his body to respond to him a call all with a little. Plantation is gone so we no longer have to fight off those pesky pineapple bugs remember them however we now have to concern ourselves with our delicate environment now in the process of healing after all those years of stripping the soil to become to come back to health. This has a ripple effect because the streams can come back more healthy and so that the shorelines also development has never enhanced property profit when we speak of growth we do not mean a building that you can rent instead we speak of trees that will give us food for free if we take care of it Hawaii as you know has a dark history that no one wants to speak about within these walls yet it is shouted upon the top of MONUC can this is the song of justice if only this small measure of redemption for the hope or system for the putting of that have struggled set aside this space in good faith for the generations to come and leave not a footprint but a legacy that the My We County Council thought enough of the history for Hawaii to give back to its people and community at large to be the example of how things can be done if allowed by political will money should never be let you citing factor for doing what is right I'm sure the chair in his rich history of pun families know that it is time for a decision on. The. Display I have here is my generation's true the coopetition this is my legacy that I have to lead by the man that is displayed in the center of this this display is a hole in his life was it was if I may be able to just don't have many many customers but thank you. For fraud one complete closing comment thank you his life was affected by plantation. Land is a plantation help to make right the wrongs and there is no who still practice. His culture this is my father who had a article made from his net and he lives in home. Thank you very much. And. Attention. Thank you. Thank you for allowing us to speak today. My name is an order. For a family life center and my position is. Families come in for who are at risk of being homeless and find their home and we have helped them with the first month's rent deposit and in whatever way we can assist them than once they were in the home a few months down the line never had to someone to follow up and that's why they hired me to be able to put the client to see if. They still in the same. Give credibility to the program and. One of the families that we did help. Program which is what we're talking about. Very eloquently. Of. Families and what I would like to. If your family member was at risk or homeless and they say. What would you do you would first feed them I'm Italian so that would be the first thing that I would do is feed them and Family Life Center for the shelf at the shelter we've we have. Men women and children and give them a shower and. A safe place to stay. Also people that are out in the community that. That are at risk come and walk in our doors and some of them. When they walk. Receive the testimonies after they've been helped and most of them will say thank you I was not. Walking and once I walked into your doors I felt family and it's no coincidence that our name is family life center because we look at every client that comes in as family as what we would do if it was my child what would we do if it was my father and. When they're sitting across the table from us and say we care we care about you we care what happens and we want you to be successful we've gone into the community with employers to hire some of our clients because. We might help with the first month's rent but then they need to sustain the rent so we're trying to fill that gap to have employers in the community to hire them also we give them. With just read our mission to the lives of people in their time of need with shelter food clothing and access to life changing support services that provide hope for a better future more than one client tell me in the testimonies when I visited them in their homes. With despair but I walked out of your offices with. Thank you very much. Good morning chair and members of the Budget Committee My name is Alice Lee representing. A nonprofit agency which advocates for social and important infrastructure improvements in our community I am testifying on two items first in strong support of the Department of Water supplies or regional budget request as you know has been working hard to support and promote affordable housing and thanks to all of you we have a revised residential workforce housing ordinance but no in order for housing projects to move forward we need water in addition to new source development such as the critically needed expansion of the. Water treatment facility which would serve over three thousand homes we also need to have reliable systems that are upgraded replaced as needed and maintained for the long term we need to conserve water use water wisely and detect and resolve leakage problems all of these things need to be done in concert to ensure a reliable and sustainable system unfortunately these components have a high cost and no one likes to raise rates and fees however we can't keep kicking this can down the road our population grows at a minimum of fifteen hundred people a year and of least one thousand of this fifteen hundred people are newborns we have over one thousand high school graduates a year we really need to address our current needs and the needs of our children our future my second request is to ask for your support in funding Holly McCool. Because our and other residents need your help as well. Thank you for your consideration of these requests and for your hard work and dedication not only on this beast which we call the budget. That you do for our community. Thank you recently after Mr Ruby Lisa Darcy. It was with the chair and will number it's my first time ever to testifying here at the county council I watched it for decades I've seen all of you do your hard work this is in regard to my children I'm here to testify for my children who are in the main and with your life with them so when they come home. What are they going to see this is an opportunity we have an opportunity to purchase a sectional than it would be used by my children don't squander it use it thank you Mr Goulden and bring this thing aside the money you can't match the model of legal and monetary firepower moving to this island you have this opportunity to take it we're about to budget day to get the land it's for our children and that's all I want that's all I'm here for I've enjoyed a beautiful life here and I don't have Molly I've seen it change drastically almost exponentially in the last few years again we have a new Molly a model with a lot of gates. Out of broken and cut off access that. We have to preserve the old mall we need to have the old way back. My dad was born or raised. Patsy Mink she she saw the future she sure this would become. You know reality. It is incumbent on all of you to serve our community just war about the money and what we can do with it later there's a lot of as I saw in the testimony earlier a lot of talent a lot of people with knowledge who are ready to put even in a private way money make this thing a money maker. Own will make it a moneymaker for them for the county purchase to do it I don't see any. Good land to provide open space for a community thank you thank you Richard can we get his name please if you could Chad thank you thank you Mr city will be followed by Joseph Gardner Good morning chair Good morning board my name is Lisa D'Arcy and I have some good news for a change I wanted to let everyone know that I am a newly appointed board member for the why public housing authority here in the state of Hawaii. And I do hope I'm able to represent now a very well that said I am here to testify on the proposed budget increase for that rates for the buses and as you know I came to know about twelve years ago because of the lack of mental health services and over the past twelve years of really hard work I really can't say that I've seen much improvement. That said I'm I'm not here to us or discuss the conditions of individuals with mental health needs but really just overall low income people that are using the bus the individuals that I speak of Earn fixed incomes generally or low incomes and that means if they survive on between seven to eight hundred dollars a month if they're lucky. So increasing even from forty five to sixty or for two dollars to three dollars again for anybody who's working you have disposable income you understand you can kind of cut out a latte once in a while but for people who have no. Money outside their rent their food their transportation this is going to mean that they're not going to able to get to appointments or they're not going to be able to get to what they need or if they're working they may actually have to work more hours in a month to pay for that fifteen dollars Again that doesn't sound like much but what if everybody in here had to work three four five six more hours a month just to pay for your transportation I ask you consider the severity of this proposal and the impact that it will have on individuals that are on fixed incomes and low incomes. I do support the proposal and I'm not caught up on everything that has been proposed so if I am behind I apologize but I did read that there was a proposal to combine some of the categories I think that's a really smart idea including seniors disabled and students into one category thing that makes a lot of sense again I don't support any rate increases but again any categorizations that we can put closer together makes sense. Can I talk on related things like M E O Gary. But you have just there yeah we support you know family life is doing great work I know. Getting cuts I want to hear of all of these cuts even incent me you know with the farmers I'm a member there too they're doing incredible work and they don't really put a lot of places that volunteer time in Please support them and really really ask you to consider that thank you thank you Mr C. . And next is just of Gardner full of smoky. More ladies and gentlemen my name is Joseph Gardner I'm here in support of the Heritage Corridor and. I was born and raised here on Maui and over the last thirty five years I've seen this place go downhill real quick. Used to be able to go camping and fishing all along the coastlines. Enjoy the time with family and friends and now it seems like there's nowhere left to go Mr Bodie said Pretty soon the only place that we will be home when new and that is not OK by me and many of my peers. I was born in right next to Mama's fish house where mama's fish house is completely taken over that whole subdivision and there is no longer beach access there. I'm under the impression that there is supposed to be ocean access provided every say a thousand yards or so many yards. It's Maui's going in a really bad direction our roads and haiku are terrible they need to be fixed there's no way that we can sustain having a thousand more homes in Haikou with people traveling to the grocery stores and country and there's just no way if any one of you guys drive on top of Gurode or any of these haiku roads you'll see what I'm talking about Also I've been doing Taro Patra work in can I and why Lou a valley and we have to work very hard just to get enough water for the call of fields it is then a very very hard battle and the more homes get built the more wells get dug the less water there is I just don't see that haiku can sustain much more homes with water the Grossman said they've been waiting for twenty years for a water meter How is that going to affect them when this whole new subdivisions get built and these new homes get put up and all these people who can afford water all of a sudden have water and these local families who've been waiting for twenty years get cut in front of in line I don't think it's fair and I really really appreciate you guys doing what you can to preserve as much of that coastline as possible thank you thank you Mr Garner Thank you Texas fires smoke you more and he'll be followed by Alexander Stiller Good morning good morning thank you Council I have a couple of. I'm sorry my name is smokable Kilmore. I'm here to speak on behalf of the purchase of the land. Six or seven years ago we had the what I would call misfortune of living in this area it's a very unhealthy space for families especially children to live that close to the ocean we had to move away from this place after just a couple of years because of the amount of moisture coming off the ocean it's a very and ideal place to develop for houses also I believe that the county must purchase this land and preserve it is one of the biggest attractions on Maui. It absolutely saddens me to think that such a wonderful place to. Connect with nature and be inspired to do good things for the earth and for your family. Would be changed into almost uninhabitable. That would just rot away them out of moisture and salt and salt just destroys all the electronics all the wiring is just like building in a desert makes no sense people that live there are local They live there a long time their bodies their systems have developed to endure what I could not endure living there and my children. I think it would be a terrible idea to develop this this area and to cut off access for people to enjoy the natural beauty thank you thank your testimony and folly Mr Stiller will be and I'm pissed. And remembers when I call your name as to be in the next up please move towards. The side of the room or the podium as. And think you. Can I'm sorry is Mr Stiller not here because it might be OK thank you. Thank you please proceed. Here to testify against the development of. Lines and support. Currently living and working every day going to work and coming. Traffic and couldn't imagine that this expansion. Highways and bypasses and shortly after shopping centers and bigger corporations will move in and many family businesses will be put out of business. Expansion Thank you. Thank you very much Mr. Next test fire followed by. Resident and business business owner. On. Support of your. Proposal. Is a very important place for a lot of us. It's one of the main reasons that I live in haiku aside from home. Which is a very special place and. If anything should be turned into a state park or in some kind of protected open access to all of us who truly do enjoy. Going to. Somebody I think spoke a little bit about the trash. A lot of the there's a lot of cars and other things that are left on this property one of the reasons for that in the last three or four years there's been quite a shift in the market for scrap metal and I'm not sure how the funding works for us metals which I believe was previously hammerhead but at one point people were being paid somewhere around two hundred dollars a car and now it actually costs almost two hundred dollars per vehicle to be removed. We're finding on the north shore there's a lot of trash dumping particularly like metal refrigerator's in vehicles I know that's a bit of a side tangent but maybe something that you guys can address because if they're if they are receiving taxpayer dollars or some kind of federal grant. It really would help people on the north shore. And unfortunately. Basically the most available location to trash and to leave leave vehicles. But as a taxpayer I would absolutely support any kind of upkeep to maintain access to . And for future generations that I just feel like not having that in my life it would really be nowhere near as fulfilled as it is at this point now. So I just hope that you guys can understand how important this part of the land is to a lot of the people in the community that you guys represent and thank you for your time thank you Mrs Astro and fallen Mr ship. Thank you for hearing my testimony. And the president of sustainable seafood direct. To basically make. Seafood Market more sustainable and. Support local fishermen. And. Stopping any construction on along any. Benefit made my job a lot easier in the future. As far as. Keeping the. Bring in Y.C. Food in locally. Because of because of just the. People here and. And the destruction of. Anyway thank you for hearing me. Appreciate any some. Support thank you thank you Mr ship Mr Bodhi will be followed by. Thank you Mr Chair Thank you council members here to ask you consider reinstating the thirty thousand dollars on line four eight three of the budget for the you Cademy a performing arts I've been a part of the Mao you Cademy Performing Arts in three different ways I've been both a volunteer actor been an educator and I've also had the privilege of being an audience member in their community productions as an actor. Performing Arts has allowed hundreds of members of our community with professional experience in performing that they wouldn't have been any other outlets on this island in the community productions you know sorry. Generate about seventy eight thousand dollars and for local small businesses. But that's just a number and really what it is is the heart and soul of these productions I guess recently I can speak from my own experience of doing a show we did that spoke on the issue of. Mental disability and and we had audience members come to these shows and each one of them was touched in a unique way that only the arts can do and if you take away that that culture and that those arts you take away the heart and soul of a civilization and then it leads me to speak on being an educator in these programs and I had the opportunity to travel to. Hundreds of elementary and preschools around the state and now it's in my county but we reach ten thousand students in our school partnership program each area of the island and we have the opportunity to share with them a show to put them out of their classroom for even just an hour and share with them the power of theater and the power of storytelling and not only that we leave them with the study guide how can they incorporate art into their lives. And it's just something more powerful than that I had ever seen I see these kids with the normally don't have access to theater and those stories I see them light up have the biggest smiles on their face and we get to bring storytelling and art to them that they never get to see county. And then as an audience member I've. Been able to have a privilege of seeing the mouse Academy performing arts shows and if any of you have seen my recent productions of Les Miserables are myside gone at the mouth arts and cultural center these shows are from the audience around us they have put it that you know they've seen these shows on Broadway and they've seen these shows in regional theaters across the world and they said it's we meet we meet that caliber . And to be able to continue to provide these services for my county I please you know I really ask you from the bottom of my heart to reinstate us and reconsider that deletion of our funds thank you thank you. We've had and if I am so we. Thank you thank you for coming this morning and following chemical. Is Jonathan was a. Good man and con some members of the chair model for allowing me time to testify when it is chemical couple. And I'm also a. Representative. Before you today to support. To save. The reasons why you know I'm from the west side. And detrimental to what say basically has been but we have a prime example of what could be created. On the West Side by saving more of our shorelines and properties along the way I think this problem is a lot larger than what we've been dealing with on a Web site in some of the concert members are affiliated with the full weight project that it went through legislation what a twenty million dollars bond so I know that the budget is set aside to say a. Small fraction because now you're dealing with the private sector. What would be the compromise vote and to consider a purchase of what is it. Less so yeah. A very big debate in front of you. My. Reason as to coming here. To go bad where everything becomes a compromise to. The private sector debt and. Whatever the recommendations from the general community that they set aside these properties for trade off a bigger development I hope that's not the case in front of his call and cancel. Debt. Sets a prime example for the general community that day represent such doing things and protecting our shorelines and protecting more of all property and one thing I don't like about what came out from the legislation Well you have five different organizations competing on a proposal going on matters is resources on the west side and. It's basically turned over to the State Department of Natural Resources if this is the route it's going on I highly encourage the colony to take whatever they need to to make sure that the colonies don't want that secures that it doesn't be turned over to the State Department and that your resources. Pertaining to qualify to take care of these properties so I just leave you with this to. Set a good example for the general community and start grabbing all these land before she lost. Future generations and going on. About what being holds in these properties. And I would like to just take a strong stance on this although I'm from the west side. Spaces and all shorelines for the benefit of the people. Of Kirky Jonathan Wald. Thank you. Good morning everyone my name is Jonathan was a full and strong. The development of the coastline near the area near the surf known as Jaws I feel that the community of the community of greatly benefit from this area and having this area as an open space would greatly benefit everyone and having this area closed off and a private subdivision would only benefit the people of the subdivision and this is a playground for the community of and. And I feel like the community needs. Spaces because it's quickly shrinking and an open space like this is for people to just. Relax and unwind and have time to do what they want to do fishing or surfing or just relaxing after a long day working I feel like these kind of open spaces are necessary for everyone and I feel like we need to have more of them and I feel like there's no need for more subdivisions like Mr Steiner was talking about. And. Coming into coming into cars. With a thousand more homes it would be it would be beyond describable already every day the traffic coming into. Part of me and I feel that. We do not need it to be all the way to Cali thank you very much thank you for smoking this morning Mr Kirk you will be followed. The morning chair right now members of the committee mourning. Your family is not the only one where sometimes our Koku is to the most exciting thing happening I was watching till one o'clock last night and I realized there is need for clarification on a couple items so I want to talk about the managed services we're talking about I want to talk about the information systems honest five. Managed services the comprehensive lifecycle managed services is our attempt to deal with the frustrations of the past as far as not having enough resources in equipment and staffing to make sure that the desktop equipment stays within the supported window of the manufacturers of hardware and software and we need to stay within that window to make sure that we have all the current patches all the right upgrades and improvements in place to. Reduce or perhaps eliminate the risk of cybersecurity events at the desktop we've suffered through that we really need to do something about it the approach shifts the responsibility to to vendor it uses a leasing arrangement as you've suggested in the past we have really no other options of making sure that we improve to cyber security on the desktop. Five position it's an existing position or somebody in that position right now doing the work it was ground funded through to burn ground not to state grants or anything else it's a renewable ground we had a gentleman's agreement with the prosecutor turned his office that it would be renewed year after year for some reason they decided to apply for a different position and left us high and dry I don't want to try to speculate why but the need for that position is still there it's focused on criminal justice we need to upgrade some of the systems again to provide secure and current and updated capabilities for criminal just information sharing and part of that again is to reduce the risk that the. From a ship gets interest up that somehow the security risk for cyber attacks and what have you it's a critical position and I really hope that you will take a hard look at finding the funding to do thank you for the opportunity Thank you Mr Kirk and questions in the next test fire will be. Followed by Cindy Reeves Tom Blackburn drinks OK we'll move on to Cindy Reeves followed by you honey. Good morning good morning Mr Chairman and council members and thank you for the further opportunity to address you to request your support for the budget line from tropical AG and human resources My name is Cindy and I am the county administrator based on the council discussions last night I am again providing the charts that I had provided that indicate the county contributions in blue to local cooperative extension programs in benchmark States which range from thirty to fifty percent of the local budget the average being twenty percent across the country but as you can see in county that number is less than three percent just want to clarify that yes we are ministered by the University of Hawaii and yes they are funded by the state and those state funds do provide for our faculty salaries. All of our facilities and operations costs. But in terms of our local programming in Maui County we have no other source of support for outreach programs to our citizens than the county budget allocation I'd like to also just reinforce for you that we are good stewards of county dollars in two thousand and thirteen retired as Administrator and staffing issues was unable to spend them on the eighty thousand dollars in support the county had provided so we didn't ask for additional funding in two thousand and fourteen however when we again requested funding for twenty fifteen our line item was cut in half to forty thousand dollars this amount of funding two point six percent of our budget significantly curtailed the local programming that we are able to do in Maui County this year. Provided for you in the testimony ten programs that have either been cut in half or eliminated due to this budget cut this includes our spot virus our Hawaii fruit fly program elimination of the Diamondback resistance management program all of which greatly impact of the crops. And. Further I'd like to refer you to the programs that we do across the islands we have landscape and golf course industry outreach on. Farmer education producing fruits and vegetable crops on. Animal beginning farmers program all of which are funded through this county budget line and all of which have been cut in half this year with additional funding we could focus on other areas of concern in the county including the need for preparing now we County farmers to pass the new food safety regulations that are coming down from fifty eight. The bottom line however and what I'd like to reinforce is that without county funding none of these programs listed here would be possible I want to thank the county council members for all of your support which we greatly appreciate and we put to good use and I respectfully request your support for the line item request for our item in this fiscal year so that we can provide and continue to provide programs throughout Maui County thank you. Grossman. Council member its my name is heavey and I just want to thank you guys for you my testimony today I support the open space fund to keep in preserve the native and culture lands of the home of coastline I live in I live great a job I go there every day its I can just go there and ride my bike ride my horse but I have been mowing my whole life grew up here I got the pleasure of trail riding horseback riding dirt bike fishing at the bay barbecuing and just simply watching the waves break at Jaws if I ever needed to find peace in relaxation I could always take a walk to be with my dogs or it could spend quality time with family doing outdoor activities like hiking biking or jogging in such a beautiful environment it's a simple way I can relieve my stress just being outside outdoors in the green scenery and seeing ocean views from the cliffs I love having traditional access to the North Shore being that this is the last remaining portion of Mali's north shore Heritage Corridor. The this place has value for its natural resources cultural resources and recreational use is. The last piece of empty land on Maui that I can think of that's left to the public this place has to historic a house and it's been my family's and my Coonass fishing grounds for centuries being Hawaiian I want to have access to all these gathering spots my family survived on to support my family members when times were hard historic and kingdom trails pass through here which is an important part of my history that could get lost in keeping this land undeveloped and untouched is guaranteeing my children a chance to know where native history comes from and how to practice our Hawaiian culture since the inception of open space fun in two thousand too many significant and special places have been preserved and saved from development how McCool law district has never received benefits of the open space preservation fund with that being said I feel that the whole McCool coastline should be perfect fit for the open space natural resources cultural resources and scenic views preservation fund with all the recreational use it has and its native Hawaiian landscapes if we could do something with this land I would want it to be farmed that's the way my ancestors would have wanted it and if they could be you today to stand up for that I know thank you for considering the open space fund to help preserve the soul be there for my children and grandchildren thank you thank you Mr Kerry. Mr Grossman will be followed by. Good morning my name is Scott Grossman. Born I grew up right next to. I support her Jewish Quarter proposal. I grew up there hiking the trail riding my bike walking my dogs taking my horses exercise you go running. Fishing off the rocks watching watching the waves. Part of my home growing up that gave me a fun place to exercise being able being able to do these things help me learn their respect and connect with the land and I think we should preserve these areas for the locals and future generations so that they may continue to enjoy and respect these areas as I have I think that no good can come from a development that could block off access to hiking trails and bays forcing people to go somewhere else and it's hard to think of many open spaces that are left. To development but also damage historical and cultural hurt. Therefore I think these properties should be preserved for their recreational cultural and historical values also I want them to be protected from anything that could harm us well being thank you thank you very testimony this morning. Mr. Sunny Colomba. Good morning my county council members morning thank you for this opportunity to speak. I'm huge support the Heritage Corridor. I think buying this land is a great opportunity to create a safe place for the youth of this island to hang out I love to fish. And. My family has been doing this for generations your annoy the north shore gets all developed it's going to be like a law who taught my kids and grandkids to enjoy this amazing island we are all living now. In this part of the island it's developed what is going to stop the rest of the island from becoming developed. Thank you is one of the last places on the island that is undeveloped and I one and I as well as most people I know would like to keep this way. This island is slowing slowly becoming overdeveloped I do not want this place to come like a wall who and all crowded this place made me who I am today. Jaws or P.R. You has a very deep meaning to me I remember being a little kid playing on the look at what's in my doubts are. The spot you my family everything and how's my parents were married on the cliff jaws I want to want to take my children to the cliff and show them how much power I'm on a this island and this place people come from all around the world just to surf and even just watch this amazing wave break is my dream to one day soon ride this wave and for him to mature my children to experience this place the way I have and if it gets overdeveloped I don't think that's really what happened. Thank you for letting me speak thank you for being here this morning and sunny cool I will be followed by William Knowlton. Good morning and again so thank you for having me here. Again my name is and I support the. Heritage. I don't know if you know the story behind but way back when in the wind. The man would bring the wife or the Roman to he and ride this powerful wave for them and that's what happened for me and my family they've got I don't know if you guys know him but he was one of the first to serve me and. Ever since I was a kid I grew up. He that was my playground that is our playground and. One day when I'm older and I have kids I want to take them there like. She surface place in this is where I grew up and I wanted to be the same for them and I want them to have the same experience as I did but. If we let someone build a hotel or something that's not. Right and for us the winds because we don't have enough money for it then it's going to be a huge downfall for us it's going to set us back and. We are not going to benefit from it benefit from it. Number one it's going to pollute the ocean the land there's already how many turtles in the ocean because of just in haiku alone it's not good that needs to be fixed and. Just the traffic is terrible by itself with extra land provided there for people from at the outside it was going to be even worse. So yeah I I feel like in this time in history the community you know what we want and we want a nice clean environment and I feel what we could do with this land is have a place for us the community to go there and just take this environment and really just enjoy yourselves you know and I would hate to see it in the hands of someone who nourish it properly. So I just ask you to consider buying this land and help take care of it and. Mr north of us Up next Mr Blackburn follow Him Good morning Mr Chair council members My name is William Melton I've lived in home . Since one thousand. Before people started surfing. To. Consider to be in my range it was open space I've walked that area I've seen archaeology the old roads it's a beautiful place. I'd like to think this counts for picking up a point. And. And I'm very happy that you guys are paying attention to. The cliffs there where I live. The next over and I see sharks. In the circle and the smart thing it swam to the corner of the bay and the sharks couldn't circle it anymore and the turtle escaped . Being born in. And I have seen. Fly right over my head silently. Like six feet over my head. The reason I bring up because. You know I'm a Christian but I do believe that I have a connection to animals and spirits when sitting on my deck looking down towards the ocean and this was. Heading towards Hina and I. Charge. The evil. And I kind of relate that to what's happening here today. That you have a bird some people consider it a thief and the protector and I just would like to my interpretation of what. The coming and somebody's got to not. An ethical developers. Their path and do the right thing I want. To look at. This these subdivisions that are up for sale and they're being advertised as exclusive and I'm almost done here. With. Coming in sorry foreigners whatever you want to call I'm walking on my trail to the ocean and these guys come out and go you can't come down here anymore and I was my wife was here earlier my son was seven years old these guys come out and go you can't come down here anymore you're trespassing that's not right thank you thank you Mr Norton and Mr Blackburn her dreams will be followed by Carolyn Wright. German. Members of the budget by Nancy committee My name is Tom Blackburn Rodriguez and I'm representing the nonprofit policy advocacy group. For begin my testimony Mr Chairman I'd like to apologize for not being present in the chamber when you called my name it was a little personal difficulty but I do apologize for that a problem the goals of now are to empower local residents to obtain housing educational opportunities and employment in a healthy environment and a vibrant economy while respecting our diverse cultures go now is in support of the budget submitted by the water department it is clear that locating and delivering clean water at an affordable price remains one of our policymakers most desired and challenging goals and abundant supply of fordable water is critical to the development of affordable housing under the current water department of ministration there has been thankfully a welcome towards planning based on logic science and cost the committee is more than correct to examine all department budgets including the water departments and ask the hard questions those questions will improve the ultimate product and make it more efficient the department has presented a plan for the future based on the need to have a den of five that council will have oversight on that plan and its execution if the department and its management fail to deliver on their plan there are remedies available to correct such a situation in conclusion. As the committee makes its file decision we asked that the committee examine any reductions in light of their potential impact on the overall Department plan Mahalo and once again thank you for your tremendous hard work this is democracy in action and makes one proud to be a million and proud to be an American Thank you thank you your testimony and access to fire is Carolyn Wright followed by Cynthia. Very. Good morning. To me of Performing Arts and. The thirty thousand dollars in the budget for me of Performing Arts. Couple of minutes here one portion of that thirty thousand which is twenty. Four Hour school partnership programs you heard speak a couple minutes ago that our school partnership programs reach almost ten thousand children every year and. About We also have. A residence in the school we. Teaching our. Community they go directly into the classroom we reach through twelfth grade and. Hand with the classroom teachers to take the curriculum that the kids are already working on. A. Biography of Rosa Parks in fifth grade or. Grade they take the stories that are already part of the curriculum and they teach the students how to look at stories how to approach the stories through the eyes of an actor so they look at it and they look at the characters and look at the setting they look at the plot the theme and. Their imaginations to bring stories to life and kids who don't effect through the more traditional and. The arts provide a really powerful entry point into learning for them. That kids. Are. Purchase a patient in the performing arts. Corps they have better attendance at school they have better graduation rates. Over the course of decades now really. Every week of the school year we go into the schools and we work with these kids to give them this opportunity and. Really important reading comprehension skills and reading response skills but they're also learning the skills the twenty first century skills that are really important for them to have success in life and once they graduate in the workplace skills that actually I saw in action here last night when I. Talk about the budget effective communication skills collaboration skills the ability to prioritize to analyze to to synthesize all skills that this. Participation in the arts provides for these kids. I've been really blessed to see the impact firsthand kids in this community on my own children and I urge you to please reinstate the thirty thousand dollars from Maui Academy of Performing Arts. Thank you very much. Will be. Eat. Aloha chairman white and council members My name is Cindy in his area Larry I'm testifying in support of increased funding for the University of Hawaii's cooperate Extension Service College of tropical agriculture and human resources here in Maui County I am currently a temporary hire Courtenay to the Master Gardener Program and acting as the urban horticulturist. The Master Gardener Program here in Maui and throughout the state is a volunteer program that is a very highly valuable service to the community in the county by providing a help desk in various workshops and classes. To the to the public this garden help desk provides answers to you know all sorts of garden questions in the past five years we've helps us address two thousand cases or problems and assisted over eleven hundred people with their with their gardening issues Master Gardeners also help in providing classes like fruit fly management. Classes which help people deal with fruit fly issues in their yards and I know that that funding has has been limited so being able to reinstate that will continue to assist the public since our we have those classes about once a month and they fill up quite quite rapidly. And Master Gardeners and their volunteer hours. Allow agents allow the agents that are being paid for by the state to concentrate on farmers and commercial AG issues and they can kind of you know a leave them of little details or little issues that come up with the public and just kind of free up their time. And so I'm speaking here testifying to get increased funding that will also allow our Master Gardener Program to expand . And a potentially create an urban garden center here on the island of Maui where the public can and learn about different gardening techniques from composting to past management water issues. That will really continue to educate the public and be a service to the community Mallee and Mahalo thank you very much for your time thank you for being here this morning and this will be followed by a call from. My name is. I'm speaking here on behalf of my son and his four friends who were not able to come today and this is in regard to the acquisition of the coastal. In front of Jaws we live in. And his friends live close by and one thing that they absolutely love to do and a very passionate about is they love to go down to John's and when they were younger we took the mountain bikes. And friends of horses and so we. Were getting older and they have their motorbikes and. To go down there and write their motorbikes and when they come back they're they're hungry and they're very very happy and there is something that I see that I feel is really important. Are very content to very satisfied. They feel like they have done something incredibly important. What I see in them is that they have gone to a wild place they have experienced them. To be one with nature they have become nature and that is something that we cannot do when there is division and when somebody gets depressed and they want to go out for a walk they are going to go into a subdivision they are going to go out into a place where there is no. Beautiful inspirational. Scenery they going to go to a place where they can walk. And selves and. I think that this is very very important you know for them to. Become stewards of the land and the only way we become of the land is by feeling the power of the land and. Not really specially with the beautiful waves and the expansiveness of the coastline. Magnificent place. I. Really consider the acquisition. Of beautiful land for the public so we can use it in whichever way. To make it into a park but to keep it and not development thank you very much thank you this morning Mr Fernando. Good morning. I'm a native. Like everyone else. Just to think about this place being developed construction and development no preservation. The Super Bowl of surfing just like what everyone thinks of as way male or mavericks everyone that people come from all over the world. Being someone who is there every day I can attest to seeing different cultures and people year after year come by. The way that everybody wants a piece of. You know having it. Or potentially block from the public to all these visitors that come and do spend money on our island and be a part of the special wave that we have here right on Mollie's to me it's kind of sad there's no really preservation No but it's there all we hear is development you know for a lot of the people that have left you know all my friends If hundred or more of and they can't be here if they were they'd probably say the same thing it's not only special to me special to a lot of people just to think that it may be one day it might be developed it's kind of sad I mean. The way it looks you know it's it's beautiful it's special to all of us that love it and. I'm in support of the quarter thank you thank you very much for your testimony Mr B. Followed by Chelsea Hill. My name is. Here. In the sugar plantation on. Behalf of and again cut in a budget on their rental assistance. I'm actually one that has is being helped right at the moment as I speak through. What happened is that. Three years ago I had a massive heart attack. Electrical contracting business. And I haven't the heart attack actually. That I'm still alive. But what happened. To have twenty five percent of my heart that is working and the doctors. Go back into. Me and what it did was it brought me to a place that the bank eventually foreclosed on and in doing that. My family. On the street what happened. Actually went. To get an application for a young man who came here from to help his parents and. Run across this. Business and. Anyway as we were talking. My situation. Assistant. Maybe might be able to help you in your family and I wasn't even aware of that. For years. People there but anyway. Qualified. Help I'm not sure what's going to be done but. If. The company. Hopped in. Transportation. Because. It happened if they were. Doctored. Council. I'm testifying in support of. Two million dollars. Preserved how much. Coastline this sacred land has laid followed for decades and has become a dumping ground for old and appliances and has been littered with dangerous rubbish like intravenous needles and broken glass. Support of my. County purchasing as many of the. Coastline parcels as possible cleaning them up and turning them turning the land into safe Parkland for families and visitors to use and enjoy. It. Privately as they are now poised to do good by aloha to open space and public access to this precious unique coastline development cannot be done please preserve this natural treasure. Thank you very much for your testimony. Mr Ritter will be followed by. Good morning good morning honorable. Committee members I am Dr John Ritter a taxpaying voting citizen and resident of metal you county. My privilege to stand before you because a private citizen on two topics recycling and. Recycling has been terminated with biased. Public laws in the news scaring people by telling them recycling causes global warming. I did a Ph D. In atmospheric radio transfer and supported multiple NASA campaigns on climate research and I'm telling you of these comments by a county employee made to manipulate the public are patently false and are shocking . Energy will build a garbage disposal plant and there's no environmental impact study the refuse to ride fuel has no customers on Maui the proposed refuse plant will require over one hundred fifty million dollars in payments by Maui County and the mayor has already unilaterally signed that contract bypassing the County Council authority your authority Council. Recycling was terminated to support large waste stream this waste disposal plant requires while ignoring the need for an environmental impact statement this is potentially illegal and most assuredly we can agree that two wrongs do not make a right it is fair to pay what curbside recycling costs according to a public spreadsheet made by a county employee who was subsequently silence and put on leave the actual cost is four dollars per year per house if the department of solid ways needs more money for other operations rather than put out a biased survey they should ask for funds explicitly for required operations in a transparent budget not try to kill recycling to support one hundred fifty million dollars contract that was signed and not ratified by the council. I also hear address the fifty thousand dollar line item for what is being called a G.M.O. Study and is really a feel good meeting and not in any way a scientific study. Peter Adler Ph D. The leader of a cord three point zero is not even a physical scientist he's a sociologist with a degree from a distance learning center called Union Institute I have read the report from choirs so-called study and it is right out of the Monsanto corporation playbook this is not a scientific study it is a small group discussion of biased papers about like a book review from a group at a library I'm a scientist and I tell you this is not science that is a sham is wasting our money in order to hoodwink the public. Cannot waste taxpayer money to fund the fake studies to quiet the masses if you want a real study and do real testing of pesticides real testing air land and water demand tracking of asthma birth defects cancers and absolutely make sure is overseen by a real science team by someone who has no conflict of interest and by someone who science career does not depend on being paid by either side of this important issue . Our Constitution demands that you protect our natural resources the public trust doctrine thank you very much thank you Dr Ritter. Mr Crippen will be followed by. Clifton bright. Good afternoon in the name south. That's good thank you. So strongly in favor of the proposal to obtain the. Coastline. I guess and I had so much to say other than that I've heard that there is supposed to be a new water feature built airport for a total of two point nine million dollars if this proposal will be able to purchase all this land from. The side of he for less than four million. And if it was to not be purchased for four million and if this all is acreage could go and build imagine at the median home price of about seven hundred fifty thousand dollars per home in haiku area. Versus these subdivision homes are going to be a baseline of at least one to seven eight million dollars per If you could get this land for four million dollars That's a steal. No pun intended but just seriously that to for such a small portion of money when the overall budgets of the state and the county are concerned I know it's not easy to allocate funds and resources. But just saying that for posterity for future generations and for the cultural historical legacy of that land in this land. I think that's point and it's what should be done and I don't feel that we would ever see a place like valley here or white or if you had. To pull the ball your or anywhere if somebody proposed to build subdivisions on that land if that if that lands lease expired it would be shocking and I don't see why it's appropriate to do so in such a place that has such a historical cultural. And traditional and present significance to the cultural and the population of this whole state in the SO planet so thank you very much for hearing me thank you Mr carbon nexus for. Clinton brought forward by a Brit in the time. I'm honored to have the privilege to come and talk to you. Right. Here I live in the Gulf we have been squeezed of water per a number of years down. My community people have spoken about the rubbish the. Misuse of the. Heart for the. Growth and production. It's good for our communities and our people to move on and strive forward. Back at the history of this place this place. A lot of people it was a community deriving from. You can see that the opening of this waterway reaches the mountain top. To pray for the rain from Hanukkah. I don't know if there is something that I could say here before you folks that had not already been said. Here on this property for forty four years become a grandfather to my. Community. Again I don't know if I can say anything that you have not heard other than I am honored to hear that his counsel has spoken about this. Historical sites upon. Privilege to speak about them because they are here. Their sites their. Just numerous have been taken upon. And I wish that the number of people that have come before you help. And with the grace in your heart and community to help. The common person. Heart for. The community. Number of people. This morning have a lot of very great topics in the. People the. Opportunities for jobs in our community. And people. Who are heritage we come before you as people. We are struggling and we need the help of you. To provide. Thank you so much thanks to chair can we get his name please Clifton. OK we got it we got it thank you. Brett penning will be followed by Elizabeth Keith. Good morning thank you. Ever since I moved here. It's going. You know it's. It's kind of a little spot we have to go. Even to even get access. Point down the road. And. It's like. To get to where you need to go to go fishing and. So I just really need to say. You know I'm in support of the Heritage Corridor and people like to go and do what we like to do. Talk about writing what I do know. More across and writing trail writing everything and it's really. Even ride really you know where you're not going to get there or anything and. Just want to. Support of the herd. For sure OK thank you very much Mr Henning Thank you. Well let me first say that I hate public speaking. Last night about coming today but I thought this is really important so it's worth it to come down and speak. Speak from my heart I'm in favor of the heritage court our time. Second generation. And I feel it's very important to have a place that I can take her where she can enjoy the ocean and be part of the community and not feel like she's being. Kept out by gates by people who are only here maybe once a year. The way that people. I feel like. I feel like. A million dollar homes all along the coastline and it's very important. For the community to build a stronger community. Based on his community and that's what makes it beautiful and the land brings to the people. I. Wanted just that's all I have to say. Thank you very much and so hard can we get her name please Mr Chair. Thank you. And Mr coverage will be followed by Paul Solomon. Good afternoon chair council members. I'd like to speak in favor of the heritage accord or beach access has been restricted considerably since I've been here and I'm primarily affected it. Has And then. Mental health that's the more time you spend in a was the less time you have. What's really important to leave behind this is the one chance this community has not to make something. But to keep it and it is from the generational families that have truly built this community. Please fully fund whatever they want the Life Center please. Give them whatever they want and need their the backbone of the disadvantaged. And they deserve every bit of money they can get. Crossed my mind a friend of mine asked me the question the other day. About taxes and why banks. Foreclosure there was not one litter in the process but they're already out of. The to keep the homeowners exemption I can see you are a property changes hands and a year goes by when this issue is not addressed but once a bank. Control of the piece of property there should be no. That they should lose that tax break immediately Thank you thank you Mr coverage Mr Solomon will be followed by a Q. . The chair and counts and then there's. Helen in haiku. And I have three items first of all I would ask that the county support the twenty thousand dollars for the life farm union chapter from the our cultural promotions grant under the economic development program to continue the farm apprenticeship mentoring program . The Farmers Union does so much for sustainability here as most you know we you know we import almost ninety percent of our food and the farm hewn is really working to help farmers here on the island thrive so we can grow more own food and do in a very sustainable way that the destroyer environment please support that Secondly I am in support of the North Shore open space to acquire the coastal land from. To pay. He many people already spoken about this to someone who lives in haiku and you know over the years if you look back over the past thirty forty B.C. So much development we've seen forest disappearing we've seen close lands that were open space that were open space now being privatized and no access we're seeing over development that the coral reefs are dying and we see on the west then that where they develop the now the silt is going into the oceans we're seeing. Life suffering. Please we really need to develop in a way that really protects our environment we have here tourists don't come here to look at housing developments they come here because of the natural beauty that we have here so please please support this. The third thing I want to talk about is the mayor has proposed a line item grand for fifty thousand dollars. To be used for what he tried to G.M.O. Study. And I know that people have talked about this but. Once again this is not a study it's a joint fact finding working group led by a mediation company and the Web their own website in this that this group will not produce original research what we really need is the original research soil and water samples and a study that's specific to what's occurring here on home in Hawaii by non partisan researchers who are not connected to the chemical companies and the G.M.O. Companies. The GMO companies they spent over fifteen million dollars to defeat the moratorium bill they spent more in court they could have funded over thirty studies by now so I also know that council members Cochran and couch have put a provider in for a fee for that item should read provide the fifty thousand dollars shall be used for a G.M.O. Study a chinup use for J.F.S. Or for mediation services and I'm requesting that the money not be used to fund the mediation services but instead used to fund a real.

Men Central Park center lane twelve fifty seven. Thank you Mr Smith I don't have a problem with that in the reduction. But I also wanted to add in or know where the appropriate spot is for the. Community Center design OK. We put money in for. The force that I thought we had some. Of it had and they hadn't used it and well OK I wanted to put in a placeholder. So you know if it's laps the radio or I believe so. Verify the status and they'll be happy to work with you look at our requests mistake was made OK thank you very much share we have consensus playing twelve fifty seven. Thank you. Twelve eighty two. System Mr coach. Consensus. It was clear members of consensus think you. Oh no the. Park system. To Ms Cochran. Members we have consensus Thank you. Elaine Dean or three of the chair would definitely support is a. Consensus MEMBER Thank you Mr Chair Yes Mr COUCH. I believe somebody mentioned a revision I think was Mr White on the apparatus Yes Yes I mean he's very consistent he. Feels if it were to come back to that when he gets here yes I mean I'll give him that opportunity. To. Destry general. Think you have consensus members. Yes ma'am. Yes yes. Yes. Yes And Carney White general fund. I have police reduce to one hundred thousand for countywide facilities. Let's see Mr Vick during a. Vice Chair Mr COUCH any comments at this time. No. I believe Mr Big concerns Mr Chair. This quick. QUESTION On That's right OK Thank you Bill. You know fire fight thirty one five Well I wasn't sure exactly what it was. Delivered that the fire department was looking at the county white fire. I don't have that. I don't have that front of me right now so. We. Can we come back to this before we finish up. Happy to do that for you. Playing thirteen. Thirteen nineteen county or if you think replacements have consensus. I think that was missed. I think that was all it was meant to do more than. They need it to have some fuel tank replacement as far as I know in the fire department. I'm not sure if this also involves what is it some of the other departments that. You referenced a fuel tank. I think their argument was it needs to be replaced because of that some deterioration. So consideration bring about. Any other comments members issues on this one. Concern Mr Wade. Page forty six currently thank you chair lane thirteen one eight hundred county wife you think replacements this is in the catbird general fund countywide. Give any comments at this time. This time thank you thank you. So you want to come back to this missing. If you think. That's that's my justification so call for whatever we have consensus on this members. Thank you very much. I don't have any objection but I'm trying to figure out exactly what this is I don't know. I said Thank you Mr Chairman they were planning on replacing two. Fuel tanks this year I believe one was on the island of the E.U. And I forget where the other one was. The cost is approximately eighty thousand for the new tank and fifteen thousand to remove the old tank and so if it's reduced to one hundred thousand that means that they can replace one tank this year and then maybe they can come back next year for the second tank. In the budget in their notes for the church didn't they just. Have to show you have next year Thank you Mr Chair and the second location they propose to replace the fuel tank was that. And that can be found on page seven forty three of the budget narrative thing is OK and also members I know have had discussions on the site. And mind you know my understand our discussions is for a better site. Because of its flood zone situation it's not our land second and. You know I would love to be able to consider another better suited location for a new. Substation if that's what it's going to be eventually So that's my part of my rush and all of the requests and so. You know I'm it's a trail on that thank you thank you so that we have consensus members Thank you. Countywide police facilities were on line thirteen twenty four. If we can show share this with. Comedian made the reduction. Think it was a chair hom I'm going to defer to the other staff at this point don't have good notes for this particular project the police. Mr Chair Yes Mark this was for a classroom at the firing range and Carter's renovations. It was for the four requests that is what we believe it. Was the department's requests. I wasn't. Like the range requests at this time I understand in need of are and officers to appropriate and so I don't have a problem with supporting the need of the departments need to be very appropriate. For our air power officer so I support the monies for taking care of that need at this thing. I mean again. Is to be able to flesh out what you want provisos for and that in the next round is you know I hope you will have sufficient time to prepare some language for us to consider. Again help me be clear. What we supporting. I'm supporting the requests on any part me regarding the. Repair work or the improvements to the police cottage facilities for housing industry so good for them OK district of the department and I prefer to defer the requests regarding the fund you need diskette agree for the improvements of the gun range it was a multiple request with. I'm saying that my review and my recommendation to use the gun range can wait and I'm happy to guess you do support the funding to take care of the housing for the I would rather see the housing fix that's the time that a policeman I know. That's my priority has. Already won it's clear you know. More background. On how I came up with the number thank you. District. On the budget narrative. And. Oh. OK yeah. You know put that on the back burner for now thank you to any other questions or issues that we have consensus consensus consensus. With the provider and. Form. Or another member that would like to offer to post language one is when we come right. Yet next round yet an extra forty seven this is under highway fund. Forty seven hundred highway for hung a community plan area. I have recommended removing from the bond fund and placing in the highway fund the. Embankment repairs. So we just fifteen the source of funding at this time Mr Carroll issues. Or are you OK with this we just fifteen again where the money is going to for your project in the first half but what numbers are. Thirteen thirty nine one three three nine Mr Carroll. For. Mr. I was the one that said to revisit on that. The discussion on bond versus cash. Yeah and again I appreciate your philosophy and position Mr coach but that's why we have special funds to take. Those needs within the parameters of special funds. Mark up Mr Carroll please. Mr White think if there's one item above that come up at rockfall. There was no request to read and revisit with yes their way OK sorry I've had kind of are and kind of a see their side. But again that's the same and then yeah Mr coach has his basic issue of what he feels should be bonded versus cash so I understand that but I think there were also we reduce these amounts of stuff reflected here but it's reflected somewhere else. The . Adjustments sef. Mr Chair The project was reduced from seven hundred fifty thousand to five hundred thousand and moved. On to the highway fund Thank you Carol. With the. Bridge improvements and repairs. OK. Thank you sir. Thank you for that members further issues say. You and any more discussion and I don't know when we want to have that discussion so you can share your thoughts now because you're going through consensus because once you once we get consent it's like going to court backed up. I've always thought that you know if it's something that everybody's going to get. Benefit out of and it will last ten years if it's a ten year bond over twenty years if it's twenty year behind that everybody should help pay for it and save the cash for things we need cash for right away. Because right now you take the cash and only the people who are here right now are the ones that pay for this long term thing and other people that come in and are properly directed to grow they get advantage of that without having to pay for any of it that's my thoughts well. Like other things it's eternal they'll have their opportunity to pay their share during their time S. Taxpayers this is how I view it. One of the things that I am doing in this budget proposal so his to better reflect to our presidents and tax base the more costs of what the government takes to run. Went through an era of smoking mirrors on debt and that to deal with that tree in my early terms as the budget. I have learned well not to train deceive the tax base on how we really powerful bills in this county and. Payment. For certain things I agree might be the only option a way to do it and I think we've come a long way in twenty years to show the tax base increment why I just seen a raising taxes what it really takes to run this county and that is why. I commend all of you for through the budget deliberation seriously and with dedication and perseverance because we have to make hard decisions part of that is to be honest with the tax base of what is the real cost of government and that is what I'm doing and part of this is why we have set up specific funds. For those needs and I believe cash in this type of projects should be utilized so that the people know exactly because they got that why you see the cash this is what we've already paid for what you. Gave you money to do some of this work. Question is then what do you tell them why we keep stashing it away I think we showing them for me. Where it's going to be holding us accountable we've seen this is going to be in this project to get to see the project and in return us to office or. Just a litmus test every two years. It will be for the voters and tax base and we see that we do a good return us and if we hit it they're going to boot us out. Thank you. I agree with your. Hesitancy to borrow and I agree with that for the following reasons Number one we have a federal government that borrows forty two percent of every dollar they spend and that's unsustainable in my view and we've already seen the results of that with the drying up of the highway fun at the federal level and all kinds of other indebtedness at the state level we have unfunded liabilities that are almost beyond imagination. So I you know the county thankfully has been kept in a very strong fiscal position. By. Our predecessors and. Those in the administration and proceeding are ministrations as well as this one so I. I agree with your your focus on. Doing as much without borrowing as we can because you know the government entities above us have done way more borrowing than I believe they should have as a thank you thank you thank you Mr Chairman and I understand you got both of you Mr White in your. Philosophies and I and I can appreciate it the other issue is you ask what we do with the cash then we provide services that other counties and other things other places don't. We fund our nonprofits at a very good level and part of that I mean all of that is with cash we don't do bond so. We might you hear the needs of the folks so that's one potential the other thing is I'm not for borrowing all the time indiscriminately it's right now the rates are so low no cents put the cash and when we can get some really low rates you know when the rates are way up and yet it doesn't make sense to. To borrow it's the rate to really help but there are low money is cheap we're not paying a lot of interest relative to the cash that's put that that's my. Right side a valid you know. Point for consideration and again it is very valid Mr Coach and it's. An approach. I would see. Your cheers for Also he has been tested I have been criticized. Knowing you. Are being to take with the people's money. But then again my point is what county or what was the only county until. After nine eleven. The resources because we had colonies because we know how to manage our own money. So for me. A team My philosophy has been vindicated through years of experience in actual situations and I still believe that it works for time as well I would see. Proposal that you want to have me be supported by increasing the funding and making that you come with a proposal to further reduce the real property cash because we're going to be for payments and we're going to borrow that and we can reduce cash more than. But to borrow so that we can spend more it's not. Something that. The council in this community has shown to be. Very disciplined as best as we can. But part of this year's adjustments are already partners have responded to our. Willingness to fight. And I think it's time to. Do a little bit more in the accountability side of the ledger so that is why I'm approaching it this way for this budget this year and next year as your committee chair to be able to see if or when they're ready we came consider loosening up the strings again and then maybe providing some of the. Benefits that I feel that they have not performed with the level of funding confidence we have given them this place so thank you very much Mr Chair and this is a great subject. I am Portuguese I come from fashion. And they like to pay with cash they didn't want to. Carry that carried a chair because if you carried a table you got to put it down halfwit and that she was talking about debt and so I totally understand you know your your philosophy and it has proven true. To the other part of it that we haven't talked about and I just want to bring it up this. Time when prices are rapidly escalating you know the cost of everything and I'm scared when I watch the news. Media in the paper and you know you read the economic. Costs are going up up up so I think that's something we might also want to take into consideration if we wait. The cost of going to have to be going up in is going up rapidly so I think that's something to think about in to try to balance it. But I totally understand and it's very safe and it has proven to be you know very useful to bring us to where we are but there's other part of it like you know if I had one nine hundred seventy it would cost me. Six hundred fifty thousand so I think that's another factor. Bring up a very good point and I would agree fly but my current seventy would be three thousand. And we know what ten cents could buy those these twenty five cent quarter could but it was these. I take into account members. But that's one. Of information that we need to take into account that is true in Crete Reppert increase in project costs. That we also take into consideration and I know you do all of you is has our attack space good reason in the same manner to be able to. Address the quick raising escalation cost of projects Hey don't believe their pocketbooks have and that is why I've taken the more conservative approach the issue of less borrowing and more cash because I feel our residents pocketbooks have risen and kept up with rising costs of the expenditure side of the ledger so. You guys bring up all very critical points of consideration and I think it's all part of what needs to be when we make our final determination factors to be part of. Our decision making process so I think Mr COUCH your point of view misplaced I missed the white. House but at the end of the day it will be what five members at minimum can rally around and come to agreement on. One can agree that would be wonderful but I know that democracy is not always the consensus. Let us move on please. Before we move on with that. Let me go back and see if we can wrap up some of the earlier ones that we have Mr White back. If Mr Wade Page forty three plane one two three zero. Issue or are you OK with the new figure for a haiku park system as long as everyone is OK with their revisions everybody has made their decision to share the pain as the phrase goes I'm fine with that consensus members Thank you. Skip. You can't wait for Mr Mintz return. To nine ninety nine. Mr WADE I know you concerned. And think you thought of the visuals of that you presented regarding. Construction equipment. And I guess you members of the mitigation solutions on page three regarding the issues of two. Very simple solution. We put it we put in a budget for a bunch of blankets and for the. Well see that. It's practical. And that. You know I pray shave your point in and out. As the members will see there are a number of visuals that provided with. Over overhead view of CNS which has well over one hundred fifty vehicles and large pieces of equipment and it's my understanding they don't have any any undercover parking facilities. For their equipment I do recall scene of one like carport for about three or four trucks. The next picture is Robert's away that has. Just in this picture and you can see there are a lot of empty spaces because it's during the daytime. Just in this picture there are hundred ten busses that are all parked outside buses and vans and vehicles. Rojak trucking has forty nine large trucks pictured in this photograph. All stored outside of course they have a they have a building where they do their maintenance work on their trucks. Trucking. In this picture there are thirty three barge. Tractor trailer trucks parked outside and the following one is a good fellow constructions with. Thirty two pieces of heavy equipment also parked outside and then the. Last one is D.H. X. With nineteen trucks in this picture I'm sure they have more than that but my point is that. I'm not comfortable with the government spending a bunch of money to protect. A piece of equipment when the private sector doesn't find financial benefit in it. And Case in point. I think where we're considering we're being asked to consider the replacement. Of a ten year old. Pumper for. All that that pump or the the building that they park it in a supposed to extend the life well if it's only ten years old and place it already then I'm not sure that we're. Better off covering it or leave it uncovered so I thank you for indulging me on that. I basically put all these together because Mr Goodman said he wanted to see a picture of my tractor. And it's it's endured I went back I've been keeping track of rainfall in my house for the last. Eighteen years or so I went back and this tractor has made it through twelve hundred inches of rain with with no cover and that's why the seat looks so bad but you throw a towel over and you can't feel the Pokes thank you so much for the big. Thank you all the hours we spent in here I have to at least take advantage of certain opportunities and thank you thank you. We appreciate that. Under. Parks I mean excuse me. It's. For Mr Grossman. Project. There is currently and in a few to twenty fifteen. There is a but project for you at them a four hundred thousand. Community Center that is still active and. So if you know that it's at least the status I can tell you of your current project as it is right now that we've already put it. That would lapse. Of twenty sixteen fifteen and of this calendar year. So it has been comparable before that time OK. Thirty first. Just yes Mr We're. Coming to any kind of consensus on. Line twelve ninety eight. When I fire up thank you I was just going to go back to that so Mr anything else so thank you for the pictorial. You know we've already passed the park system improvements and you've received consensus on those items but I asked staff to go back and. When we had that discussion about whether we should put a million dollars in the operating funds or not and yes I remember the staff several days ago to back to go back and. Pull up the C.I. P. Levels for the last. Starting in two thousand and thirteen and I think it's important for us to point out to the department and to the public in two thousand and thirteen we spent three point seven million dollars in C I P for parks in two thousand and fourteen. Three million three hundred fourteen thousand and. For two thousand and fifteen we put. We put in the budget over twenty four million dollars and a good portion of that was the sixteen million of that was. Jim and even if you take that number out we're still over seven million dollars of new C I P over almost doubling the previous year without the gym and this year we are out. Of the budget started off with about thirteen and a half million so we're well well ahead of reinvesting in the in the parks we have been in the past years thank you for that and still wait it's about to give us. A copy of this. Staff and you don't mind I would like like Mr set so we can follow the conversation. Keith thank you for doing this this really shows on one spreadsheet. The changing requests of appropriation members as well as. How we currently are. Approaching from the proposal. To appreciate choose weight and now assists as well as a chart you know for us. Hystrix all so many questions on that spreadsheet to date any for clarification members. Will be passing it out. Yet at least you know express that out because I think you went to Mr Baez thank you. Back to twelve Ne Ne Ne. Mr. EXPRESS. Consistent position any other issues by the members. I would just say members if you had the chance to walk through the. Station. Is a very small stage there is really. Training or fitness area that used to move the trucks up and use the babies as part of the coverage area. If you look in their living quarters areas. I hate to say but it's like. Facilities and sizes and. Then when I look at how we've approached it train to come up to a more modern type of environment for the firefighters. I understand Mr Waits comments and I take it to heart. That when they need some improvements and it is the only station plus the community is looking at that during. Some of our natural disasters like her hurricanes or flight issues. People are going to look to the station as a reference point then fuel resource especially with the emergency generator force of generously supported. My request to increase the capacity of the ice making components because that's where people are going to go they're going to go to our first responders facilities for guidance and assistance and for me there is no other governmental facility for this community to go to. The federal. It is. For that. Thank you Mr Chair and I did get a note from the department you know one of the reasons why they asked for this and other corporate cover was. Years of coming here and requesting equipment and being told you know we're buying this really expensive equipment for you guys better take care of it right and so they took that message from counsel to heart and want to make sure that it's cared for in the best way possible that when we were evolving here firefighter program. The county did buy a. Fire truck in one hundred sixty seven I believe was similar to a door ran in under heavy equipment because of the mechanics gave the service and mechanical support to the county but even then the community of you cited so the company put up a firehouse for that one truck and the county's investment lest it thirty years plus. The department doesn't want to see historical piece of the community that he quit because it was a volunteer weekends they went and washed them polished it they mean any less to this county thirty years of service and I thought the county got its money's worth out of it B.C. With Mint So that's why I don't have a problem asking for certain things because we can get the life expectancy we want out of Whitman Mr White should send a mechanic who took care of it over to take a look at number ten down for the injured people have retired from the Gulf for. We have consensus over ninety nine ten thousand dollars. I don't have a problem agreeing to that as long as I think it's important for us to look at facilities other than the apparatus bays if you say they need prove. Banking facilities and areas in which to to work out or train or whatever I don't have a problem if if Mr Buzz is amenable to just call and eye for a station improvements sort of apparatus to Mr Boss Yes that would be good thank you. So that my proposal to you members would be to rename this. Program here and on a fire station improvements it will be still a ten thousand dollars out of general fund. For this requests consensus consensus Thank you. Page forty seven. One three six zero. Zero four. For Mr. Ford another apparatus. To. Get Mr Chair. WHO HAD to this item keep. Your recommendation. So that forty nine members. So he comes. To have consensus. We're going to move forward. Thank you I'm going to wait till Mr. Victor in on the mists of the parking lot I've done the proponent of this project I would like to allow Mr picture enough to have some opportunity for comment. Let me move you on page forty seven. Plane three one three six zero under road improvements Highway five central upgrades we had consensus. That. I wanted to bring up is Mr Good brought up the point that this can wait then he doesn't need to say when he thought was in dollars so my point to you members is you can leave it here or you can take the director's recommendation and zero this requests then use the seventy thousand dollars left and use how we fund to either balance. At the end of decision making with regarding the fund or to face this in another area within how we fund program matters so I'm just sharing that with you that this is what we can do with this seventy thousand dollars. If if the directors feeling that way I'm OK holdin off I would prefer not assign it to another. Item Right now use it to balance. Yeah because. Again membership one of the things that was that was not transfer into my Panix. That's not general fund now we're shifting between two specialty funds of solid waste and highway. So now we're not doing the transfer we have to balance highway fund and that is why I'm saying that there's opportunities for with the seventy thousand to make those balances but I just wanted to make you aware that this is how I would like to look at the fund. So that we have consensus. I don't recall that's why I don't know why he came up the other day Mr Molina. Transmitted a letter indicating that they're OK with reducing pushing up this project here you know he's going to come back next year OK OK it's a consensus think you. Do we have over. Twelve thirteen six three commitment Avenue. I don't think Mr culture has. Mr coach. One three four move from the bond fund so the highway funds look at this one three six or so. The first. Thing you write on that I have issues with that I have a right to know and. Then let's go to thirteen sixty seven. Sure. Myself. Want to do this project because Mr Good is. If I'm not mistaken and I'm ready to pull this into committee. To get it going like the shovel ready the green. Wire high later to revisit your great yeah I think you mentioned something and. I'm feeling like this area is. Place for improvements of this sort so I hate to go out for a tire year. And I know it's a big chunk but. That's why I wanted to revisit it I'm a. TEACHER So you know we look for you for some guidance. You know and it's gone. This is why we're fun OK. Yeah I'd like to put it back you have. A key. Somehow missed a couple just or good when he was here the other day said that he is expected all the documentation to be completed by this week if I'm not mistaken yes. And I know you don't know the concern earlier was that we didn't have control over the. Control over the land we only own one of the four legs on that intersection. But he said that all the documents to dedicate to the three remaining legs would be in this week. So this is what I would request of the committee. Why don't we leave it the project in but I would ask if we can. Go through this route and then look at what kind of funds is available so thank you for supporting that we need that we don't hear market for anything yet so we can balance it's a big. I guess that's part of the challenges that the committee has and I have. To work with through it so. We'll find a way that's what the committee wants will find a way. Street resurfaced scene and. During it's not here but move it from the bonfire and then reduce the amount to one hundred fifty thousand and think this through was OK with. You mention it to me so I would just so I was going to ask the of this out of any of the issues even that we have consensus and consensus think you. Can't. Place too. Move to the bonfire. And subtract it from the highway fund five hundred fifty three thousand six hundred twenty two dollars and suffrage of those involved to Mr Claus Yeah. Recollection this there's a bunch of federal projects and this might be one of them. Odd number five fifty three six twenty two and vacate that it's a certain percentage of the amount yeah. So Mr COUCH any problems issues I have no I don't know who did the revisit with. Mr Vick Reno. I don't recall but it was concern was you know well you know something it's understand Mr victory is serving our our position in the at the Capitol right now. So unless he brings this up as something he really wants to bring back I'm going to ask for a consensus by the members and euphemistic coaches position members who have consensus consensus Thank you Mr Chair Mr Coach just. A comment on now a lot of Parkway Mr Good apparently listening and said that the amount of the all the paperwork has been sent to Mr White so they're ready to go thank you so I'm going to be that we're going to. Have it. Resorting to the budget or a budget proposal and we'll work with the funding so if Mr I mean Mr Good is this in the end they really need. A better number than one point four million. OK. Under highway fund company why. This is for two hundred sixty eight zero sixty eight. If you don't mind members at this point in time I'm going to. Request that you consider just the six million dollars that we. Keep the two sixty eight zero sixty eight for balancing purpose that will more than likely be looking at the well we learn any project Parkway project so any issues on that and I believe I believe we have said leave it open and because it is a balancing thing towards the end so everybody's so many. Issues to choose recommendation regarding the county or a resurfacing and just leaving it at six million you know issue no problem. In regards to this section. Talking point in the community there and I know it's on the books with director good to do but if there's a way to reinforce that yeah with the proviso that way. In his research. Project . You know I don't know how to. Make sure protective that is going is a given you know after this your own safety review Mr Cochran I'm going to. Give all of you as members a reasonable break to work on the third row and to be as specific as you can on your proposals you can maybe contact Mr good and since he is listening that he may be able to offer you some suggestions OK. And they can present that in the next row . Thank you thank you Mr White. You know. My concern with this repaving fund has always been that it's important for us to allow the department to use their systems of identifying which roads are the worst that get it addressed first and. My only concern I don't have a problem with focus on my name but. It's earned is if Mr Cochran wants to proviso and I want to provide I've got about seven or eight roads that I want to provide so because I'm in a wet district on it and the roads are pretty John and and he's got a list. Of his priorities and I see just one of those areas right kind of feel like we shouldn't we should be messing there because they've they've been focusing on doing roads in a methodical fashion to get rid of worst ones addressed first. Point Mr Wade and. I guess if I was running the program. And instead they would appreciate your comments. And yet I understand Mr Cochran because we all come from districts and the district comes to us with their specific requests. So I'm going to ask Mr Bozzio some thoughts and thank you Mr Chair Mr Good is listening and he did just text me and say that he is actually on the fiscal year fifteen list so we'll get done with fiscal year fifteen moneys. OK yeah I. Want to double triple make sure. We all get in our districts. I trust it'll happen in. Public. Phrase that I'm going to share with you that we're using with the federal agencies particularly the E.P.A. And that is the phrase trust and verification to be built up and increase the level of trust in these to be verifiable so. Mr Good. For you so we think Mr Good and his there department for the good work and I appreciate Mr weights comments because. I believe that Mr Good tries to do it is fairly and equitably as possible and I think from the results. That you need to support the directors decisions. That we have consensus regarding the. Recommendation for thirteen for that pressure to six million. Going forward and then use. Additional for balancing. What is the next line we have fourteen or for. Mr thank you on line thirteen ninety six Are we allowed or are we going to wait until the next round for provisos. Well. I've had several calls and to place a street light on the corner of command. And. Street I did speak with my staff spoke to David he said it's very possible because there is. A pool already up there in that area and he said it would be very easily. Done if I proviso at least ten thousand of the four hundred. Do you have that written. Stuff if you. Think it is written proposal for provide. So that we can have it for all three thank you thank you for doing that Mr. Anything else is. A traffic calming program two hundred is there any issues you. Muskoka chair. To. Implement are going to be deducted from this figure per director good. No I'm looking to take actions in order to pay for the. Equipment Operator for and labor to we believe consensus that did not consensus the Labor at this point so that's up for discussion to revisit. And but the front is where this is where it's going to take from and with discussion with Director get on the floor he was OK he's found a huge drop in. Work from this section from that community and felt very comfortable in. That many. Knowing that this is Highway friends that is a. Proposal from his Cochrane regarding the position. I apologize I was responding to an e-mail. So Miss Cochran is going to work it's a good. Thing for us to consider that we can we do not some of the monies in traffic calming that is currently under highway fund countywide can highway funds in this category be used for positions also. Not if it's in the program you could remove monies from this and put it into the operations program and then proviso it if you like. That would be the gate instead of the budget director is given it's not through the C.P. Component but from the operation site so. I have to look at operations we can adjust from here to put it we transfer them OK to operations and see if the comedian we got to support that but I would ask that you check with Mr Good since this is highway funds yes. I mean that as a suggestion for you. Mr Good is with that he just texted. Thank you Mr. Technology. And I. Can't figure so we calculated that for own three. Chair the equipment operator is thirty nine dollars thirty nine thousand three hundred sixty dollars. And eight month calculation on the highway labor labor to be twenty five thousand six forty eight and so a total of sixty five thousand and eight dollars you get that Mr Cochran Yes sir. Total. Thirty nine three zero OK Yes I got that. For to your proposal in grown three Keith thank you. Page fifty. Anyone requested to revisit Lane fourteen thirty that is under by highway fund countywide. Improvements. I think that was. Mr victory no I'm not sure. Whether any other issues whether other members of the committee. I'm going to ask for consensus on this missive going to has great heartburn. Approach to church and. See how we can assist him and his issues is a consensus on four thirty one consensus. Let's move forward. On a park party drainage. Before the end of the recess Mr Carroll has been from the chair and Ucas may also verify with him that. He's OK with the choice proposal his one major issue within the staffing of council services that is outstanding for him but that he seems to be pretty supportive of the church's proposal so if Mr Carroll's office is listening we. Are drainage bond fund. And I have recommended this for this year to delete that from the BOD project Mr Chair Mr Coach you said he talked to you that he talked to him so he just talked to me he was missing you said if anything he wants that in OK so that's why that's what he told me before we can be OK OK And that's why I just made the comment to his office if you're living here this is what's. So. You know they'll be rolled three and so if Mr Carroll really wants us to. Reconsider it that would be fine but other than that I would like to still keep moving. So I'm going to go with what he shared with me just before we end to. Them being at one forty five. So we have consensus. It was in the US. Until Mr Carroll comes back. Road improvements we moved. To the highway and we already got the consensus earlier going to move on from the one. For the kid and I road safety improvements of five hundred thousand dollars. Mr he said he was fine with that and with this members of consensus. We already did the next two project members that embankments of why apply in the way of play bridge improvement so we'll move on. Is there are requests to review board in every new bicycle improvements lane four hundred sixty two yes. It would like to. Be have most of the bike community. Feels that this is. Just for the downhill bike. Folks they say that it's too steep for regular bikers to go up or down and they have consistently said that that project. Seen this is a project years in the making. For those of us that have been here so yeah it's interesting now that we have this comment but. It's every since I've been sitting in this chair every year OK. Well you know. I don't know exactly what this does whether it just takes care of some of the dangerous areas on the way down. Mr. Details of what the administration's plans were to do with this. Fund. I mean. Right now. We come back to a chair. Thank you for returning. To the. Most things that pretty much you've given agreement let me ask you to look at page fifty five mark if you have Mr Carroll playing for thirty five. This is regarding for your district the HANO ballpark drainage. Problems with a bit. We're going to have to go until we get. There was too much concerned about where the waters would. Look to we don't know yet Thank you Mr. Issa Carol case of members we have consensus and it supports Mr Carroll. Thank you very much Mr Carroll. And Mr Baez OK thank you so five hundred thousand dollars in the fiscal year sixteen proposed budget is for design and the design is going to be based on findings. Which they're in the process right now. So members Mr White. And like to. Leave it in because I think you know I think the residents are bike paths and I think we have a responsibility to do those but at the same time and really we have a responsibility to our drivers and our downhill bikers who provide us with a safer environment and just like to point out that like. All the people that come from Mr couches and Miss Cochran's district to enjoy a very fun thing coming down the mountain and I think we have a responsibility to make it safe for our drivers and safe for our visitors. Thank you very much Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and. While I understand what Mr White are saying the bicycle community did say that they had gone through down Baldwin and said identified places to do pull outs for the downhill by companies and Mr Good is aware of those he said he couldn't do that on the pavement because of the Federal Aid project but he is aware of those that. Concern as well. But. I recall in testimony and he'd hear and in a country two people were saying not for not for that one thank you thank you. Thank you very much Jack. Controversy. And I've had people come and support the new improvements and I've had people say that can wait. To be completed first. I don't think that they're saying it can't be. That they would. Have just come on come. Sure as the King thank you for that. I would still like to have. The design left and if it if the design evaluation determines that the pull out so the thing that do I'm fine without but I think to provide a safer. Passage for both our drivers and our cyclists is something that is long overdue. So members I'm hearing your discussion and. I'm happy to make that just meant that Mr Wade is proposing to leave the. Resign mining in but I would also ask that although it's not a revisit that you look at fourteen sixty four the chair is supporting the mayor's proposal to move the North Shore Greenway project forward so I have left that funds untouched which means I support it to move forward so it's in the budget the North Shore. Pathway. How much money do you think would be appropriate for the components. For this your book report and every new mystery Do you have a recommended figure. I have no idea but it's at five now you know you want us to knock it down to three fifty. Members. Recommendation to reduce to three fifty and leave it in the pond from those on the road improvements district it's a consensus. Just meant to move forward. There are a hue to fifty to. Forty . Seven. Election greeds. Issues members. As. I speak up on both of them the problem I have with this is I don't know. If. I can tell you from having been in several offices on the seventh and eighth floors. Says. We have. Rights and I know it can't be safe. To say this is exactly Mr Mr Boss I'm thinking. This campus electrical grid system the majority of the cost is replacing the transformers that are in the basement of our building they are and we've kind of them we leave been told that they need to be replaced because if they do shut down there could be significant damage not only to the building but then also. A significant period of time before we can get replacements in. The suggestion from department was to get this done right away so that majority of it was that was that costs. Thank you miss by such. A tight technical person I. Am. So whatever you. Share but I just. Have to be kicking the can down the game. Except when I am. Technically. Right and I'm sure it was given and that's why it's here. In review I believe. I looked at the overall scope of their proposal. And again. Mine is more of what can be more than likely doing the year. Of what they would like to do in the year. So you know at this time members you know I think one point two million dollars of upgrades is still a good figure and if they come back in time we spent one point two million with little use additional than that for me production performance and ability to then in the next years budget additional support that some are prime approaching this misplay so. Let's get started Thank you but I'm with you that's good because I would really like them to work on leaks be safe. We have consensus members. Thank you move forward. Expansion twenty nine point eight four million dollars. Despite OK I asked that we talk about this because it's a. Hundred and twenty dollars. Less. Impact that. Going to do. Whatever I need to help the intention is. To pull myspace and members one at this point in time as I really don't know. If they listen to the earlier comments. We should be building for a reasonable length of time in the future I've heard the committee throat at least thirty years of planning this building has sort of the county for fifty years. And my understanding of the current projections of if we go with the. Short stubby version it is good for fifteen years and I know of the members were talking for at least thirty years of life and expansion opportunities so that obviously would take the biggest structure and have higher costs. So that's one factor is what do we want to build. And it is my position only as an individual member and I prefer to wait for the audit report. Second. And in that manner I don't have a problem since we're using people's taxpayers money to do. On this project require and. So for me there's no way they can be infrastructure you know next budget. Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and I. Wholeheartedly agree with you on there's no way they can be in construction especially since their reaction to the design that they proposed to us was. You know when hell freezes hold work and I think because that was I mean just as I was about what the original Right what the original design was it went against everything that pretty much everybody here knowing what was going to happen and. Wanted to have happen so. We asked I think we asked and the Go back to the drawing board and come up so that's that's why I removed it from my proposals Well thank you and the other comments so issues members. We appreciate Ms base of having us have this discussion misplaced. Take. Whatever needs to be. About I mean we already gave them money and that they currently have that they can use. The redesigning components so I think at this time unless Mr comes back regarding additional costs. And one thing you know I know you have all been aware of what he has done we're getting some other projects especially the complete computer project called fast spend millions relate to his consultants. And if you spend what twenty something million what and now the governor has canceled the project it's not going to go forward. The county doesn't need that kind of experiences Mr Whyte Thank you Mr Boss can you look up how much has been spent from the one point five billion dollars that we allocated for design believe back in two thousand. Yeah two thousand and fourteen. I agree with Mr COUCH that the design they brought back to us was in complete contradiction to what they had told us they were doing just I think about three or four months earlier. They had come to us during the discussion about the. Service Center act land acquisition and stated that they were going to. Reduce the building height by half. As one option. Build a building for non-profits to be housed in as a second option third option was to leave it as a parking if that was the fifth option but. They also made a recommendation sell it or or allow another developer to develop the lot and so all these things were being presented to us nine months after we had authorized the design work for a nine story building so I think they had ministration caught us all completely off guard when they presented what they presented. At our meeting with them a couple weeks ago because I think we all have to Mr Ching sat here and said we're going to we're going to build a nine story building and to come back what maybe five or six months later with something that's cut in half again so. I'm very uncomfortable moving ahead with us for that reason and other reasons you mention. This was I'm thinking it's a chair so I'm not sure if there's any outstanding Billings but the. Campus expansion design was appropriated one point five million they have spent today two hundred seven thousand and have about one point three million left over. They have enough money for. And they have money. For all that he was one hundred seven thousand dollars of the design for a long long way from maybe and stretching you know we have consensus and. Thank you let us move forward. Before we hit the next one. Let me give you a quick update from Mr Reno representing their interests at the state legislature. Just what occurred this morning host but one thirty four which is the legislation regarding the general excise tax. Conference Committee will be meeting at three forty five this afternoon the Senate has not moved from their position of a point five percent for five years on the surcharge and the House is not budging from their point two five percent surcharge for twenty five years which means if they reconvene and do not reconcile both houses have agreed to an internal that which is six P.M. Today if it doesn't get we can solve by six P.M. It is good for this session it is still a life for the next that just laid of a year in the buy and which is next year so the legislation does not go away it remains in his current status as a conference and next session if they move agree on the first day of session they can move it up for a fight and or reading quite quickly. But that is the current status we're getting House Bill one three four as of lunch from Mr victory and. Let us move on to. Page fifty three I have a request for a visit line fifteen zero six this is the. Improvements and bond fund. Christians issues members that this is reduced to three million dollars. It was fine with the. Cochran. And have done wonderful improvements so I didn't make sure this was going to hinder their positive progress forward in the work they're ready started and are currently I believe doing. So if. I just didn't want to hit you know hinder his operations basically and wanted to make sure before consensus to vet it and make sure make sure. And I appreciate your good work in your committee and I'm sure all the committees will. Be very assistant to this committee upright the next Budget session since I would S. All the committee choose to use the departments would allow you to have that initial pre-budget review so they were possible you could assist them during the budget process I believe three million dollars will allow Mr Good and his people. Enough funds for this narrow parameter which is only cut he killed the highway. To do enough improvements because that's where they get that. Broad parameters Miss Cochran came the beautification a slight walk spike that's drainage bridge repairs maintenance. Ladies So I think it's three million at this for this upcoming budget year is. A good number OK yeah. Of course. Make adjustments on the way for me so that's fine. Thank you consensus members Thank you. Main Street I know this is a Mr Victor renos when I mention tended we did move. To many moving into the high we did reduce it. Looking at the parameters and school of where they're going to resurface. And so that was how we came to moving this way and with the reduction and I still think Mr good with his crew. Will be able to do because I'm banking his previous and it's may be outdated but I believe most counties that do research get at least thirty percent more for the dollar than if they went out to private contractors so I'm banking on the thirty percent additional productivity that he considered this as a possible in-house project and that with that ability to get more for less with the company he'll be able to take care of the project parameters so it's a challenge in a sense for him but. He's raised my expectations and level of confidence in this program America's they've performed it performed well so that's why I am with this request members any issues questions consensus consensus. Thank you. Lane fifteen. You know this thing members I am not. Comfortable having you to move this forward. I would like. The subject matter committee to take a little bit more. Definitely goes into one that will come before Council regarding entitlements and. For me. As we have done with other. Entitlements requests I would like to see what the property owner project proposed developer or have it may be to see what is the scope of the. And if anything what is the public community benefit that they would be offering and if . In my opinion do not. Satisfy the council's concern for public public benefits then this might be one of the requirements that I would consider imposing. A condition of entitlement did the pay for the extension and that be. Coming from the tax base but from the proposed. So again it's just a different way of approaching total fund but this is something I know it's going to come before us in the near future and it would come so she would have us weigh in on public again a public public. Benefits from the project and then Council can do the balancing. That is my request to you members issues questions for the chair. We have consensus. Let's move forward. Park irrigation system on length fifteen thirty four. Is that you Mr Coach Yeah and I think Mr White agreed. But let him say that if you do. Since we removed some. One hundred thousand a little over a hundred thousand another fine and. Wanted to keep the sixty and just in case they had almost a million I believe and to cut it down to sixty would is fine it would be OK but even further I'm not sure if we're on the edge of that or not you know it's fair this affair. You know that these decisions are always a little difficult and. I just have to share with your indulgence of a quick story and then to move ahead with the demolition of a building on one of our properties and and line up and. So we had three beds I call the low bidder and I said I understand you're hauling materials. So if I can get approval for this job in the next you know couple hours can you cut your bid from twenty seven thousand dollars down to something lower. If I can a lot if you can fill your trucks up on the on the trip back because you actually said yeah I can drop it from twenty seven thousand twenty one thousand so I sent my boss in Hong Kong a note saying. Tell him what was what we do accomplish and I thought I felt really good. And I get a one sentence response you have approval to proceed at no more than eighteen thousand dollars I was crestfallen. I was so embarrassed I pick up the phone I called the contractor and I said I'm really sorry but I I can only get approval to get get. Moving ahead with eighteen thousand dollars he says OK great We'll start tomorrow and I thought Here I am sitting on the same island and I don't know that there's still money on the table and that's what you know when I and I think of that all the time when we're looking at these numbers and thinking you know we at the at the hotel we've been calling that the Hong Kong squeeze and I you know I think these moves are appropriate because it does let people know that we're not just you know daddy big bucks and I know it goes through a bidding process and so forth but I still feel that some of these adjustments are are appropriate but. I don't know what the scope of this. Project is. But that's a heck of a lot of money to spend on irrigation but again I'm not. I'm not qualified to say whether eight sixty is is good or not. That that's the difference members Mr White got the response in two hours it would take months. And . So. I think you if you could. Let me be the parameters in the span of this part irrigation way for me Mr coach is asking us to. I restore the sixty thousand that I'm working on ending as a reduction. Second here thank you. So. Clear sixteen they were planning in designing and construction in one year of the automatic irrigation system to utilize the R one water from Department of Management. Water for way put on your part so the. Request was one hundred sixty five thousand of general fund money for the design and eight hundred sixty thousand dollars of fun monies for the construction so. That's so they think the hundred sixty five was cut. The sixty thousand dollars cut from this it would be for the construction so might want to rethink that and if if the committee desires to maybe do design this year in construction next year that might be an opportunity Mr coach the only thing I'm concerned about is that. And I'm not sure if the ordinance applies to the county but as soon as lines are available you have one year to to make use of them and those lines are just about available. Is that a departmental rule Mr Carro ordinance it's my understanding it's an ordinance. Any additional comments members missed. You know I'm OK leaving the sixth there. For the requests from as. Is Mr Coe but I have another question now Mr Baez mentioned that in this money be used for design. It could be I mean they're expecting the whole project cost one million twenty five thousand. One hundred sixty five thousand dollars that was previously cut by the committee and had consensus then. Died I don't know how far they can get with eight hundred thousand. But they can start to. Need need be as Mr White story suggests that if they actually get it in for eight hundred sixty thousand then great if not if they need to come back and say look at it really do need a few hundred thousand more than they can come back. And let me. Tell you Mr Coach I'm sure most of you or all of your already know this but let me just. Remind you the department also has the ability to either hire if. Consultant services or go to a qualified this should a department and after council of people like Mr Boss of course and Cooperation Council go to the qualified list then it becomes a bull amount not good so there's opportunities to further reduce costs by successful in negotiations by using a different role for the consulting selection and for me as what I'm challenging IT departments to look at the whole have routes to get the job done and if it's that you know they say well Council is like concerned about the amounts maybe we should go to the qualified option to the law allows us and negotiate a better price for the project as a coach and part of the other issue. Is that right now the park is being watered by each individual condo so they each have their own system their their own sprinkler system. I know the Parks Department wants to pull those out of but new ones in to make it standard but. Like you said that might be another alternative is to tap into those systems until. Such time as they can design a good system and whatnot so you know I am going to see that as. Because this is putting money to so and we are going to use it we're not going to. Borrow it. I can I'm open to your request to restore the sixty thousand dollars Mr coach but I'm just saying that you know we know that there's waste to train. Value. Engineering type of work to reduce costs right exactly and with what Mr Boss says about what the other one hundred whatever already I mean it is I'm fine with I'm with taking the sixty out because they're going to have to come back anyway one way or the other if so yeah OK so you don't want to sixty because I'm saying I'm happy to go back after the discussion with Mr Baez and why not I'm fine with your recommendation. Yes Mr White thank you decided to share that. After my comment about. The construction I think I got a text from Mr Good saying I wish we could bid and negotiate like that in the public sector but I think that really brings up the the challenge that we have because we sit here and look at all these big big numbers and I know we all get frustrated because I think Mr Carroll put it the best I've ever heard where we we have a very simple design villian that had a bag. That they wanted to extend and. And the if I'm recalling correctly the design would be one hundred fifty thousand dollars and the construction was three fifty or five hundred thousand dollars and Mr Carroll correctly said you get. You have a design it's right there just copy it for the slab put the hollow tile up. Put the roof structure on and you're done that way before we've spent the first hundred fifty thousand dollars so on you know. I really think this our procurement process needs a major overhaul and because. I know what I'm able to do. In construction practices and I wouldn't want to operate the way Mr Goulden the and the others have to operate because it's it's cumbersome it's slow and it's very costly Yeah and we're we're just. You know I remember. I think it was not this past Neko meeting but the one previous to that. Where you all had organized how the secretary of transportation come and talk to us and he said that one of their main focuses was going to be looking at the process because they realized that the process is so time consuming it's unbelievably too costly and when you don't have money to go around you've got to make changes but I don't see those changes coming anytime soon but we've got to we've got to do something it's a national issue for colonies antiquated procurement laws so that the state of Florida . That's in there with the states footing the counties back because of the state procurement laws that's archaic and doesn't fit the current that times and needs. And so I would agree with you on that you know for example in dismay. And discussion with the E.P.A. Administrator this proposed rule that's going to affect this county on waters of us is Can years in the making Can years. What rule. Tells you how that government level works. So we have consensus on. Eight hundred thousand we'll move forward. To the next speech make it happy to give you a break three forty five. Members we shall return to order. We are going to go page fifty four Elaine fifteen thirty eight before we start any discussions. The staff will be handing out for distribution to the members of the committee. Additional information regarding requests for information one is from the Department of Fire. Turnouts helmets. Issue second you would receive for the cutting of beach part master plan three a law in a restoration capital project and four responses. From the Department of Transportation. To those. Departments to give us the response to requests I think them for the. Hard work to get this. Right to decision making so thank you very much. Under fifteen thirty eight. The church had recommended a reduction in this area. Since I felt that the six million dollars We've already have consensus on regarding resurfacing rehab was. A reasonable amount of funding for the. Fiscal year proposal. And so that's why I did this district kind of request since we left it into countywide. Chair and. I know from director good he said that. These are. Important roles but they're also federal aid road so they get federal matching on these roads. Then he put those in as a special request apparently because of they were federal aid and then had other plans for South. That still has much needed repair and it's a very heavily traveled road so. He wanted to have those roads plus the section of Southie here road that's why. He wrote is in the other. Section section. I will also give you an update members of. The reauthorization of MAP twenty one which is a surface transportation bill before Congress. Impacts basically the highway system the state some transit components. A bond requests. We are going to know very shortly what Congress. Which option to going to most of them prefer not to kick the can down the road they're looking at our position which is a six year. Term and. That leaves the Senate Public Works Committee and he's in charge of. The highway fine. That's their dilemma you know how to deal with the solvency of the highway fine because currently used to do nothing. In two months it will be no federal dollars for praja. I let's it's already been committed and encumbered. So for me members I don't have a problem if Congress responds. Responsibly and we already have because they have as our a staff Miss Jessica Monaghan who works with Mr White we have now bipartisan people in the House and Senate willing to restore the thirty percent. Funding power we had ducted from the extension of current map twenty one where they gave thirty percent more to the state. For their. Allocations and if they felt we could use some they would give us the current language and I was being proposed that the thirty percent would be put back and the counties would have jurisdiction on those projects dollars for federal aid program projects. Seem that members. If they go for short term it's going to going to be to allow the operations to be able to extend to the end of the calendar year just to buy some time. To see if the king. Gets stuck in conference committee on how to secure the highway fund. For things like repeats and a few other new terms to Congress to make up to. Confusion. This . Issue so for me members who would care for this gain weight if Congress acts and we have those funds available since this is him I'm happy to quickly expedite the budgetary Amendment requests that Mr Goodwood sent through Mr Boss. And that's my main rationale of why are pretty or prefer to be live it more cautious and wait till Congress can verify my action. To move surface transportation forward. Which Thank you and also the flip side of that is we could authorize it and if nothing happens with Congress it just goes away. And that's another way of doing it but. If there is a federal dollars then I would like to have the department come in if possible Sure specific projects that they would like to do within the district so for me it's another chance for council to get updated and be specific on projects yeah I understand they have a press now. Just. Understand what you're saying and I still would like to revisit that I want to give you an update from Mr victory no if you're interested. Did the compromise is that half a percent. Surcharge for five years without roads in limbo that was the. Language with withdrawn by the House and the Senate has agreed so it looks like they're moving. Into a compromise and. We still have a big decision to make when it comes to us but just so you know that that's where they are now. I'm not surprised the state is going to punt to the colonies and not take the responsibility of raising the roof when you state the need for their requirements like the hospital what's new. And what's new so I'd like to revisit that Mr sure we can do that. But unfun kind of. Drainage system. Mr. Thank you chair this is OK with that OK Thank you. For the comment from Miss after check in with their work too good to have consensus members. Thank you. Mr government facilities kind of police I was concerned about their reduction and I haven't had a chance but I don't think even the acquisition of land is complete so OK yes. This year this number Thank You do we have consensus members says THANK YOU THANK YOU. OK My concern and yes I really would like to have this restored. The high cost of construction. On my island. Is very high. My concern is we don't know what the bids are not at all they'll be availability for. To come in for and men men. If that may be or can we just put it back. I know he the Department. Has fun. But then you know we want to get the longer we wait to put it up for our P. The higher the cost and that includes shipment that understates you know. The whole works can you tell us how much we have currently appropriated. In this. Project to secure the current appropriations four and a half million dollars. You know one of the things that. I was told to all the committee members is that when it comes to that we have supported and put money in so when it comes to the additional a reasonable additional amendment to get it done you find. To be happy to expedite the request because I understand the issues and I face is the same situation regarding additional costs for construction I understand your argument completely. But the challenge is if that the Parliament can work within its current parameters that would make all of us very happy but then again if need be I'm happy to go through an expedited consideration and amendment. Share. Getting that confirmation and commitment from you that. Should the situation arise that the department will need to come in for an amendment you will expedite that and I can surely appreciate that and that being said I'd go along with John King thank you Mr White thank you. I would also like to ask the Department of present you know we just authorized. The change in the title to allow for a sign that has to be spent and again my concern is that it's stated there for me back the plan. But it sounded to me like they were going to maintain all the elements and I don't concur with all the elements so I thought we were clear in our view for its parameters for the people while I thought we were too but it sounded like Anyway we haven't seen any of the rework designs and I'd like to see that early on because I would agree with you if if it's coming back the way we had outlined it and it's a little over budget. I would support that as well. But if they come back I don't want them to come back asking for the money at a point where they've expanded the design beyond what we talked about last year and showed us the plans Mr thinking as a chair Well I know when the department came to discuss this with the budget amendment they did describe what they were moving forward with that the time so they did give authorization to. The architects to complete the design as was presented at the budget amendment a few months ago so I don't remember seeing any and they draw they passed out a drawing of a read through the redrawing and stuff like that I'll go back and. Thank you yeah I really meant something Mr Good yes but I hope. They submitted a budget time last year because it was two elevations with nothing much more and even though it was a three to three separate buildings I chair. They worked on trying to. Follow you are not recommending any so we have consensus members. Let's thank you let's move forward County where drainage improvements. Reduced this in half for one million dollars issues. Thank you. I had. Spoken with director good as well and he had asked that we still do this because he has enough work. For the full two million no. Mr Cochran any comments I have Director. And I'm in favor of it. Chair you have other research that proves otherwise you know and I know that you know that something that there are three moves to respond after that see a major storm or that. Has a situation that the Earth can respond quickly. But there's also a movement in the legislature of the Senate to review the North Shore. Is questioning some of the requirements of improvements and for him the issue of that with a sidewalk this like gutter which means you need a drainage system which means then yes because it might connect. And so he's. Recapturing the water like get it to a level where it goes back on the land as irrigation. And revising the code of what is required infrastructure for road programs. And you know this morning he again showed on the one of the news stations that this is something he believes the state should pursue. In recycling or using drainage water and maybe they need to change standards so that might not be a future requirement for state projects. Because of his concern to sidewalks the two for infrastructure issues down the road when the main thing was kind of interesting discussion from the state center and I was quite happy that a state salaries. Thinking in this areas that was quite pleasing to your chair Mr COUCH you mention that he talked about it for state has he also passed that. You know the pay and how we structure the statute that he's working on. Then I would ask that he allow the county be able to make those decisions as a home rule regarding our subdivision costs and specifications OK thank you so it just sounded Yes discrete discussion of a drainage. In Kearny what is of the impact Drene edge and so the impacts this county and all are sister counties and of course as an island state there's always that huge issue of always kind of the ocean or an island so. It's just you're in a pleasant discussion with the. Mystic which I totally agree with you but. Along those same exact lines another unpleasant thing is the whole M S four. Stuff because of our new status of now an urban. District because they were able to knock a roach in the urban district and take that we had discussed that in. Discussion with the. E.P.A. Director Emmis for predatory acquirements. And he was not happy with the colonies because we pushed back hard or engineers have pushed back Public Works their work to push back our stormwater man you wish that. Rule. That was what they wanted to hear from us but the county stood firm on our position that. We don't need the rule interpret it after they make their rule we need the rule to be put in a manner that it is a workable. Improvement. Including permitting for the colonies and that was part of the issue that they did not want to enter into. With. Requests but they gained you know I wish I had the bit more specific so Mr White had recommended we. We restore five hundred thousand entire month because this is bond money they can come back to us and say they need additional. I would. Put that before the committee as a compromise increases five half a million dollars to one point five from the original two million requests can we have consensus. Five hundred thousand in this to one point five million dollars. Fifteen for under the heading of county wait facility building improvements. In. That. Wasn't me fifteen seventy five. This is. Reduced in half so my proposal is to give them seven hundred fifty thousand dollars for county or a facility building so unless they come up with a specific way they do is in part so public. This is the. Reply. I'm OK with that kind of consensus consensus will move forward. Other projects. Like you know Larry have. Issues. And. Had come in and explained and not trying to be self-serving but this chunk is two assists shelters for West MA in particular we have been on the list we see improvements here in Central and South and I guess I'm. On the list we're going to go to help fund that and so therefore I would like to keep it in to assist with the build up of shelters and. Provide. But. Get it completed within the school but they're requesting that I believe they've gotten they have are kind of they're not moving forward but the ones on the list are are they got all their ducks in a row to complete. And. Are you aware of what the average cost of a stop and show. Vary. From twenty five and gone to sixty five plus A and it's just a matter of. Requirements. Average cost of construction. You know including. The. Facility is about eighty thousand dollars per stop. At least more and more like ten ten for you. Hundred thousand right there. But I just meant that I think they have some. Things that. Some working. And we've heard from. Them and. That certainly would appreciate. Shelter for the less. Any of the comments. And it the writer ship numbers and what have you and I think between. The numbers are the highest So we have. Extra route. To assist of the north and and it's. And it's in. Support of thank you going to ask Mr Manley my fee is an additional comments you could share with us thank you Mr Chair the director of transportation indicated that for this bus stops and shelter project they had targeted fifty shelterless of which twenty eight have already been constructed thank you so there's twenty two remaining in this one million dollars with the cure how many zero to twenty to twenty two. They're planning on building eight this year and he was four and West million four and center might. Thank you for that for creation. So you for the requests three store that you're is open to this consideration and it's a good measurement and the department whether they can perform or not Mr Coach thank you. If he said if they said eight and eighty thousand average were ten Yeah. Eighty thousand to one hundred even if it is one hundred thousand and still only eight hundred so I'm fine with cutting it down to maybe eight hundred or seven hundred thousand Mr Jenner said was the other part of this funding is for design of next year's. Bus stops so if you're using one design that would be the idea of the county system they they do reuse the sign of the of the structure itself but the site works and they need to do you know assessments and surveys and all of that for every individual site. You know if some of the areas that they're proposing the stuff for is part of the areas that we have to for it to. Be for all agreements for the property owners. You know. For improvements. I'm not sure. Of that I know that we have recently at bus stops are only kind of a new feature in planning commissions requirements and so. Putting in one but I don't know if any of these are have different regions but we can discuss that with public works yeah if you could maybe have public works and Corporation Council. I want to know if this has any impact on this for all agreements because if they do I would like proper knows who agreed. To pay their poor at a fair share for the improvements because that's the understanding with the county and those executed agreements so I'm just trying to. Do more with what we know he's available Mr COUCH Thank you Mr and I that's a great idea. Understanding in what we went through the process is that it's for road improvements. I can stretch and say that's a road improvement but that's totally up to Mr I don't think he's very stretchable But my concern on these again are. They're putting him in the highest traffic places which is great perfect except for they only have three to six seats in them that just I know they have to do what they have to do and they want to keep people from sleeping on the benches or whatever but. It just is defying logic. So. What's the what's the average. Three to six. Or nine or whatever every body puts out a big. Bridge where OK OK. It's Cochran thank you tour and one last point speaking to the department is the shipping costs of these shelters they may be prefab fear very heavy and unfortunately living on an island we shipping things they say I don't know what the numbers but Brant just the sheer ship. Which is unfortunate but the price we have to pay. Is space so if you have a comment. Initially. Questions that everybody's asking about. The seating and whatever. You know. That's the path. To stop it. People like. Want to be under the sun. You know I'm from the old school you remember. Yeah. Yeah yeah but. It's got very difficult it isn't like. Money but I think we can go there still. Get some money it's a people get out I don't mean. Any other comments. I'm open to. Coaches consideration at this time for. Hundred eight hundred thousand members and we have consistent. Eight hundred thousand. County way to equipment it's a coach. Thank you chair. Most of the stuff again and it's the whole bond versus. Most of the stuff is over. The ten year I think this was going to be a ten year bond right Mr boss Mr. Yes when we issued bonds for the. Kind of what equipment it was previously authorized We issued them on a ten year maturity OK and I do want to commend the the Department for keeping. A lot of these vehicles in the twenty and thirty year range and make keeping them running. So that was just my concern thank you the the bond versus Yes No I get that you're always appreciates your point of view Mr of. I think we pretty much. Pretty much of accepted the chairs philosophy and proposal and this and so. You know and I have issue with additional discussion but I think we've already made a call on the path we're going to go forward so. Saying that we have consensus. Thank you Mr Chair just about I did have a question was the. Fire truck still in it was trying to add up the numbers and just make sure. You knew. It was checked. Left then I know that the. Left on bond which was the special funds division so it's a special funds. Mr Chair Yes the two point one six two million and the bonds was it was to protect purchased Department of Environmental Management those are four thousand gallon truck rolled off truck one fifty will rebuild or and two twenty eight cubic yard with these trucks and the fire truck down there was a really. Mr White and beliefs. Staff run off a loader that is not reflected in this in the. Description here on page fifty five. We should probably confirm that the number is still correct. With how the committee staff. Chair Sorry I stand corrected we deleted the one nine hundred. Fifty J. Model J. . That was for woohoo. Well there was we have that we included the nine fifty J. Loader for why Luke who is in public works department down below I was referring to the mine fifteen eighty five. Staff read off another load are there. But it's not it's not listed there so the way funds. From Mr Cho straighten out our list and we'll get back in a couple of minutes. Report back to the committee once we get for free the numbers thank you for that question. Can we turn to page fifty six Blaine sixteen thousand. Kilometer. Campus expansion one million dollars left spawn. So before I ask you for your comments I just wanted to know that. What you didn't ask to revisit but where we are you know this is a delete you look at the broad project above halakhah highway intersection at Marco Wow. That is what the church did substitute it deleted cologne on Maui and put that one million dollars. Because it is lapse upon proceeds to a project that would qualify and that you see in. A project above it and that we already have consensus on. So that's a status any question is misplaced. Not a question but I want to say thank you for helping this to happen you know this is really really going to make a big difference in traffic haven't you and I want to stay in public to represent. Here's what we hired help get state money to help make this happen so you know he's clay it but he's very effective. Thank you thank you. Members so I'm going to move on. To lane one six three six on page fifty seven this is the new super fun. And Unity plan district. Model for. Mr Cochran. Chair if you don't mind can I go back to my park system and what a number sixteen twenty four I guess that appropriation is sixteen twenty two yes and in this area would this be appropriate place. I have discussed with the partment and the district is looking for a batting cage at the line a rec center and. Some playground playground. Covers I guess now the kids you know slight the metal things or whatever in the playground as I just gets some words only hot especially. We're still a son and all so. Just some kind of coverage over these which looks like a two hundred fifty thousand price tag so I was looking to provide these out of this area as a cow that work or one. It's going to need to pass I guess Mr Baez's that yes because park assessments funds has a. Restrictive parameters kind of before maintenance and then before repairs were basically new We're seeing a. Situation So Mr Bush here in this Congress intended use. Would you feel this is inappropriate. Fun that she can do her proviso. Mr Chair and like to let me confer with the department real quick about the scope of the projects. Miss Cochran Have you discussed this with the Department. Director savage and deputy director can say whoa. Notices So I got the. The community spoke to me in reference to a batting cage and I had asked they did some research and came up with the figure of one hundred thousand and then they asked me in reference to perhaps can you look into getting these covers for the playgrounds in which they've been asked for the district so that's why you're here and yes we've been conversing and have both come together for these items and figures so Mrs. May be doing this in a third round and I'll discuss it with the department before then we just want to make sure that the funds can be utilized for the purpose your intended That's right and thank you very much chair and I understand but I also made sure I double I wanted to make sure that they're good to go on something like this I don't want to appropriate proviso and then just let it lapse in war where's the covers so according to the department Yes there they feel very confident they can accomplish it and so I'm supportive but anyways we'll do our due diligence on this and come back then thank you thank you that would be appreciated. Surf on sixteen thirty. You know waste water pump station them birth three. Thank you for your. Gas I never. Missed these to reconfirm with Mr and his department if any of. You know the progress of these particular projects I hate to have any of them not be covered and you know fully funded to accomplish and that was my reason for wanting to kind of hold off on a consensus and to revisit and to make sure because these things are very important as we all know perhaps to a sister their consent decree obviously. Just to better the system in West which has its issues. So. If there's a way to come back I'm sure if I can kind of get through to department. As I mentioned I said I would give you time between the rounds and combine it with a dinner break likely where you will have time to check with Department. Under this area as members are getting their modifications. I was. Concerned right now with this is. Their ability to. Replace and putting the brand new types of photos for the current plants in. High enough. And I know I made big cuts in the B. And C. Accounts and so I did get feedback because. One of the things that asked and maybe that departments can think this is a lesson learned. To help did you for our directors prepare for next year's budget. Process believe me to share with us when they ask for things to get in the context of one of things that I pass and verify with and I would say consultant. We've got in this field issues for me and that's why how I'm making adjustments on the. Way in the modifications on the pumps to get the money is for this filtration system done in-house what it's like costs and how it impacts premium paying me the estimates of potential third party outside contractors doing the same work for the division and what I got was that. They're looking at Operation money in for just a quick and money of a ballpark figure for the whole lease the plant would be about eight hundred thousand current estimates to go to a third party is one point two million dollars So the department doing in-house Lemus a good to some of the repaving in-house there is there should be a savings in this project that four hundred thousand dollars or one third. Of this for this one plant makes sense to the chair force and I had to get this good information from the division but if they told us up front they went through this analysis and that is why they're asking it in this method manner I think it would have made this a lot easier because they got the information the comparisons of doing it in a different way and then showing us the net which is the benefit of doing it in-house Rhasis hiring outside contractor. You know I asked for the same type of analysis and it had a very fiber one of Slate. Potential. Is not currently doing it for the county he believes that house for the plants would be almost one point one million and if went outside for contract work it would be about one point four million so there's about a two hundred fifty three hundred thousand dollars savings again and I had wished I was able to share that earlier with the chair before my proposal. So that's why I'm open to some of the BE consideration members you know we had time to go and verify certain things I also asked Sister counties for some comment and that's I can tell you I am. Happy for those that. Don't have some reconsiderations that sorry approached it and let you know why. I'm sticking with my proposal at this time Mr Cochran thank you for six thirty seven. And three OK thank you for your explanation justification I'm just bounce you know really quickly. Sixty and seventy two and it's in reference to Conny way to waste water system modifications and it looks like you want to leave five hundred grand there so I'm wondering if I know it doesn't offset the deductions you have. Recommended but perhaps they could go to that if worst case scenario the. Last minute of that sort it could come from there maybe Mr. Mr Boss. Thank you Mr Chair So. You're discussing a reference to the. Couple improvement fund. You plan. Making. And the other one super fund countywide but it's I think that's it for the same uses you know like if that thirty thousand that got deducted for a pump pump station they had to have it they could go maybe take from the county wide to assist. If there's enough money in the county wide that's possible. That. A lot of money was reduced in half right so you had a five hundred Yeah but you know thirty grand so you ground might be OK yeah yeah but they get Yeah Mr Cochran This is the part of me come back to. Consent issues or complaints you have to say and I consent but complains issues. I think compliance is part of. I would see the concerns the church did not touch two parts that has two and a half million dollars for county wide and that's on the next ph fifty eight C. I didn't I thought you anything that would compliance. They've left the mayor's proposals intact so if they can convince Mr Abbas that this is in the way also as part of compliance they've got another part of two and a half million the remaining five hundred thousand that's three three million dollars members that's of able to assist them with some of these things so again. That is my my thoughts on it then you know I know you do a good job in your committee miscreants so. And I appreciate your comments thank you very much. For the just feel comfortable just running that once through the department just give me a chance to respond and I hear them also so. But they hear your so I'm sure. To them into how they're going to respond Mr to hear you a question. That you set aside in the. Capital improvement reserve fund for water improvements. Is it your intent to allow the departments should one of these projects be significantly over and there's no money in the county wide project to be able to come with a budget amendment utilizing those funds. And again members this is something that we're going to me as a Committee recommendation to the council that's my perspective was that. I was just there for a while and I we are at what forty four years in the sewer system it's eighteen I know we're going to have to deal with some replacement issue soon the rest of the county has older systems and I saw a replacement of the main transmission lines is going to be a concern. I was looking at more for that type of a fund to take care of those future needs which is the line replacements OK wanted to understand that Mr Jenner So let me get the rattlers moving forward you know and I'm trying to make it fit within the charter parameters that's why Mr Boss. But again. I don't mind having the fund set up the number is based on the carry over savings as I shared with you earlier yesterday. If you feel that to reduce that amount for certain things because it is part of the sewer fund this year is open if that's the cash it's cash. If you want to go with that cash because it's already been pretty much collected and that would be every overseas. For you to consider as another source to take care of some of the needs of Mr Cochran. Instead of additional Bahrain but you know I'm happy that for you to go and check with the department Mr Miller you know you have anything to share with the committee thank you Mr Chair just want to pry clarification that the project for the county wide waste water system modifications is used to address high project beds and cost over runs thank you so. Our staff comment thank you. So you see I want to review this with the department that's fine so we will come back to two three and four Now you also want to do the short end of this station then yes OK so that so yeah that one Section two three four five and you want also the West my recycled water expansion I made a reduction of three hundred forty and left one million three hundred sixty for that project. Consensus on that which are OK members you heard Miss Cochran's comment regarding lane one six five. Four and the appropriation West small recycled water system expansion one point three six million dollars area of consent Mr White I would just. Sort of well if I were Miss Cochran I would want to revisit the number two and number six and consensus on the other two because they can clearly be easily covered out of. County wide. Yes thirty. Thirty thirty and twenty can easily be covered by the county wide so but I think the thickness Cochran's point is correct on checking with the department on the other two big ones just to be sure that we've got a good number there well it's got green you for his suggestion for Mr White. Yeah but would you like to do a yes unfortunately I couldn't get in touch with director today. I mean that's a good I mean those are big ticket items you know yes I'll just. Visit the two big ones and consensus on the three small because they can cover like you said the thirty that's all you have other parts of three so we'll go ahead and do that venture can we have consensus three four and five if that is pump station five modification six modification and. Wastewater lift station the consensus will return to the two big. Projects number two and number six. Slain sixteen seventy same page fifty eight county worried wastewater system modifications again this is the sewer fund. And. I think that your did not support any increases in the sewer fund area in my proposal. That's correct Mr Williams Yes OK I did not support any sort of fun increases as. So I'm I was trying to adjust because there wasn't going to be as much cash as currently proposed by the mayors with his rates so I made some adjustments Mr poach Thank you Mr Chairman I understand. Your position on that. Again in another meeting. That wasn't it was a different committee we had yesterday yesterday the day before. The director was talking about doing incremental steps in the next couple years as opposed to one big step increase when everything comes to a head so. I may want to chat with him on that because there are some things coming up that we're going to have to pay and stead of doing he was talking about a fifteen percent increase through the next year or the year after that slight thank you for the reminder you just put in my brain and part of the position is again that we can I think a lot about it in open session the chair is preparing and learning from some of the . Experiences we have with Kmita of the whole issues. I would rather look at the budget requests for the up and moving modifications forward once we understand the amount and specifications of where we're going to go after we settle some of these legal issues then I think we can make real much better informed decisions on how we're going to put resources to the modifications right now we're going to be guessing because we're not sure where we're going to end up until we come to a final resolution so that is part of my thought considerations in making this recommendations to you because I wasn't sure where we're going to go until we get settlement Mr White brief recess sure recess for the chair. Thank you for that short recess. During the recess the chair did frame the support in correctly. So Stephanus some Alina if you can they give the updated comment please thank you Mr Cherry Yeah I misspoke earlier I am what I meant to say was that we had an increase in any of the Superfund spending on c.a.p However the chair did elect to retain the merest propose increases to the sewer fees. Which would which is approximate to generate an additional two point three five million in revenue for the sewer fund thank you thank you for that correction so it stands corrected I did accept some of the mayor's rate increase but. Again. Any additional comments on Lane sixteen seventeen countywide system modifications Mr White. I would agree with your cut based on the fact that we have some other items later that. Were. That we've eliminated that we may need to look back in. Consensus consensus Thank you. That's good to. See peach fifty nine this is a. State we've all been fun. And the world community planned district showing homes Force mean replacement. From just sixty leaving them on that. Two point four million dollars Mr coach. Just curious as to why it kind of looks like the number they owe us right now. Which kind of looks like the number they owe us very. Actually I. Like over a million a million you know OK. I mean I was just curious what your at rationalization was on the. Issues with Mr white chair my recollection is that this looks like about the same percentage reduction as the adjustments that. Cochran is going to go revisit right department yes I would just ask Mr Cochran to add those two projects this one in the next one to her list of three visits with Mr. Or U.K. We have not a problem I can do that. To. Mean in return to number sixteen they should. Have destroyed not mine I have one. And talking to solid waste they have disarmed comfort and the. Amount of funds that were spent on the landfill berm and they're going to need a approximate three hundred thousand for that to continue that project in two thousand and sixteen so you have a place I want to like that. Yes insert in mind sixteen ninety one. It would be a lot of work with staff to come up with the wording but it's basically work on a landfill or. Remediation work. In a landfill on a landfill right total of three hundred thousand. Come from the solid waste fund Mr weight yes I think you. Think you need to. And she would get our calculations. Keep track of the staff because when we go fast we need to be able to balance and make the right adjust. So we will be happy to have you work with the staff and then we can then have a. Good review in the next round. Sixty we've got some big boys here. From the probably our one water distribution system makes mention and. You heard the chief. You know on. His report. Members Miss Cochran you know you need this you know all the issues are. The chairs proposal. Trying to recall I had a discussion with. Trying to think. What is sentiment right where I know where this is. In relation What's the other one I'm revisiting what's my recycle water. But I also want to point seven also yes of and I don't want you know. The one in to that's the big boys the twelve and a half million for speech one. And seven million for our wine. Expansion. Thank you if you don't mind when I'm going through these other items with Mr you know can I also bring up with him because we were discussing you know. Third of that plant shut down they're built out in one thousand seventy five and they may be you know bringing it up to par. There are one in justice with the utilization of. What can be created and what have you so upgrading the plant basically. So to weather bring it up to the caliber of what's Vero look for newer higher technology type. Filled out so I think they're sort of talking and I mean this is something that is part of. I don't want to not have anything in place good faith effort I guess so disciplined and. I'd feel more comfortable to not consensus this just straight out before I have a discussion sure and so that's my recommendation OK Well I appreciate your caution Thank you Mr White thank you and we did have a discussion with Mr Going to those. Whose position was that we that the twelve point five million dollars project as Miss Cochran related is to rehabilitate they closed portion of the waste water plant and because it's not capable of treating the water to the degree required and I believe that had something to do with Trojan content it was and wasn't able to get the. Achieve the right level of. Treatment so. So I my sense is that we. Probably need to do that and that's that is a big boy but. There's a there's currently a big section of the plant that's used. On the previous one mine seventeen twelve that's the just the distribution system for taken. Recycled water down into kind of poly and that's part of the system that. I don't support at this time because I was not clear to me that it's a good idea if somebody is complaining about us putting our one water into a two hundred fifty foot well over over twelve hundred feet from the ocean. This project takes that same water and pipes it to all the hotels are right on the ocean and water tables are only about eight feet below the lawns of the hotel and I don't my property. The drainage rate is about eleven feet per minute so it doesn't take this our one water anytime at all to get to the water table and right out to the OK so I just think this is. Half baked idea. And I think we should hold off on it until we understand more about the implications OK thank you for anyone else's comments. Cochran you going to talk to the US. Yeah at the traditional. Review of the proposal since requests for revisits. Would see anything I am willing to reconsider really members is the second project to twelve and a half million to me that makes sense but. I'm happy to allow Mr Cochran to have the opportunity to try and have a discussion with the department and receive for comments in the next round thank you thank you. Water Supply worried upgrades in replacement fifteen million down to zero. Issues misplaced thank you very much Mr Chair. I had the opportunity to discuss this with director Taylor because I was very concerned and I didn't want to just go ahead without having the opportunity to talk to him. Makes a big point on this he would like us to put this fifteen million dollars back and the reason he wants to do it is because it's help to improve or larger change the capacity of the treatment plan and he said that the project is almost ready to go they are ready to go out this year design is almost complete the other thing is he's concerned that if we don't use the money we could possibly lose not only the money but also the allocation of water that we've got. Decision so he would like us to put this back. Can you give us a little bit more specific so. Please I'm sorry. There's not gave us more water allocation but there's a clock attached to that I would misplace so I don't I don't know that but Mr Taylor is present in case we want any specifics I asked him maybe I should be here because everybody knows I'm not to this water committee and he definitely is not and unfortunately my vice chair who has done this for so long is very busy on a well trained to deal with the G.T. So Mr Taylor is here if you want any specific information he also said that we had . We had put money in line seventeen forty seven and he felt if we wanted to restore a day we could take some of the money out of there. Thank you very much for that Mr . Are you able to give us some comment on this location and if we don't. Put to. The allocation What is this all about please. I'm not familiar with the settlements I apologize. Any objections to having director Taylor come down to respond to this question. With us if you would please come down to the podium and give us understanding of. Elocution and what it would mean that we would lose the. Opportunity. Thank you for joining us thank you Mr Chair I had heard the question in discussion and there is no clock ticking on the allocation but there's also no guarantee that the State Water Commission will respect the allocation if we don't use it it was allocated to us based on the understanding that we needed it and so we do have a concern as a department that we want to show that we're ready to use it that we're going to use it as quickly as possible and that we actually do need it. Members questions for the director on this project area. Anything from human space no. You know I think. It's important to restore this so. I support that any better than he does. Or any other questions for director at this time. Because I don't Mr Tibbs is this . Was a coach may I ask him one sure thank you Mr Taylor. There's been comments on the floor that you know you've you've. You've asked for people projects or money for projects and there are no results showing up. I remember some stuff that you said you were going to do you have done in the plan that you showed us how where are you on your plan because that is a big consideration here of why there's a lot of reading I believe that if you look at the actual projects we've listed. Only a couple haven't done I think we over budget it in past years and we lapse money but other than the six million dollars for I believe it was called the phase ten booster pump stations. Last year that was part of the sixteen million dollar carryover savings this year I believe all of the other projects were on schedule. We also had the West Maui Well that was also ready to go out for construction except we had the hydrogen logic problem so I think what we've done is probably conservatively budgeted a little high which is I think more of the reason for the. Higher carryover savings and lapsed funds but I think if you look at the project lists those are on track with that twenty year plan that we've been working with Water Resources Committee for the past few years. OK. You also mentioned I think on the floor and I can see how like you have county wide upgrades and replacements whites' fifteen million. There were some discussion on the floors to you know a contractor comes in and knows that we're going to pay so much. For. A project and you can't bring him down or you know get one project or one project there you're not sure what the prices are going to be that a pool like this helps you move things around and get jobs done when you can at a cheaper price of possible I think you mentioned that on the or it might have been in a private conversation but I thought it was. Mr COUCH I've heard that discussion and one of the reasons we do group projects is it's hard in this bidding climate to know what's going to be high and what's going to be low so it allows us to keep projects moving the other thing something the committee has been talking about is this letting the contractors know how much things are going to cost by grouping things they don't know not only do the building contractors not know what the actual price is but almost more importantly the consultants don't know the qualifications based selection process for consultant selection is not a low bid they are chosen based on their qualifications and give us a price so when we tell them that we have five hundred thousand dollars for design of this their price comes in at four hundred ninety eight thousand dollars if it's just grouped with a lot of other projects they don't know what our internal number is and will give us it might be in a much better position to negotiate that's those are the reasons that I prefer to group these based on the projects that are in the twenty year plan that the Water Resources Committee has seen that way we don't charge cards to the consultants in the contractors. So that's why you have the big fifteen million. The fifteen million is actually part of county wide project the fifteen million is an ass or a loan just for the treatment plant construction. Misplaced So thank you one where a quick question before. The. Upgrade or change or whatever you do here I know. What or how much we get. And if we don't get it what does that mean it's an additional one point five million gallons a day to the central and south Maui water system and if we don't get it done that's one and a half million gallons less than we would otherwise you know have. It just gets us closer to the point of maxing the groundwater water and this water is the least expensive water we will probably ever develop again that plant which is located at the fork in the road from Yellow Valley heights it's a it's an elevation where the ditch is high enough that the water's pressurized where it doesn't have to be booster pumps to get through the filters and it's still high enough to fill the tank and serve the community it's this perfect location that it's just the actual cost of the plant and minimal electricity operations there's very little pumping involved and it's one of the only locations that works that way usually we have to pump before and possibly even after. Thank you very much thank you. So. We have been working with the landowner and they are ready to give us a right of entry for construction and then move on to land acquisition when this land acquisition anticipated two in this next year how much I don't have the price but I believe it is I believe that land acquisition is included in our current F Y fifteen. Budget. It's the same landowner that is has a well development deal in this conference committee as we speak ready to be heard . Are the questions for the director. Thank you chair the chair if you don't mind since we have director here I have proposals pending that continue it's in the water section and I have my offices been speaking to Mr Taylor today so since he is here to maybe reconfirm that discussion and it's in it's in assistance to my additions and where he feels it appropriate to take from within his budget. So if that's allowed and OK OK great thank you very much so director Taylor you know how I'm looking to reinstate some of the funds back to watershed programs and so I was trying to just bring it back to flat from previous years which administration has proposed and so it comes to one forty seven five hundred and you had mentioned that it could come from line seven hundred forty six which has a nine point five plus million dollars in it and you had said that it could come from there because you feel you're not quite ready to utilize that amount just sit there anyway so can you comment if I have it correct I commented the other evening when I was here that I felt it unlikely we could spend a significant portion of the nine point six million dollars on that line item and so. Unless there was a specific project that the committee has in mind for that. I don't think we are in a position to encumber it OK so the chair I just wanted him to relay that that comment back to this body that we had she asked again we create policy to budget for them to implement whatever this committee and have counsel. Be that they were give to the department so we wanted to go. OK thank you thank you direct myspace so since we have Mr Taylor here and we're discussing what are the next one you know my asking at the same time because. I'm Mr Turner can you comment on what are restricting countywide water supply. Placement we had eight hundred thousand dollars had any was removed at some length seventeen. Give me just to. Have the information with me. When I see. The eight hundred thousand dollars. There are two watering tank renovations and A. Tank pressure control system for tanks within the wide wide variety of areas. Tank it serves a and. Some other tanks and pressure stations located throughout the county OK So we have it's been removed so tell me why you have to have it those are existing facilities for existing. Customers to the tanks degrade over time steel tanks that rust they have to be renovated and then the equipment that keeps the pressure constant that's old and rusty too and also needs replacement so it's something that is if it isn't included this year we would sort of make it work the best we could ask for it again next year OK thank you very much thank you any other questions for a director Taylor. Everyone there to tell you we appreciate your presence and responses to the committee's questions thank you Mr Key. Let's see. Key we were we now. Going. To. So members you've heard Director give us responses to questions and this is only for one project so we could have coded the. Check here instead of a county where IT upgrades. Lots members fifteen million dollars. I'm still not ready to support this I mean I'm not convinced that there's any interest in. Providing additional source or assistance to other areas of the county that don't have a prayer of getting a water meter at this point in the next ten years. So I'm I'm not not satisfied that this is a is an important project. It's not an important project for me right now the water's not going to go away it can be delayed a bit. I'm just tired of hearing no solutions for a country water users and to use the cost of pumping. As a rationale or the expense of developing as a rationale I don't and I no longer buy because a lot of the people who are waiting for water meters are below all three of the systems and. There's no added cost to provide service to them so I'm. Not an not a happy camper after four years I just don't see. Any significant movement I don't see any significant concern or emotion coming from the department so it's my. Challenge with probing this of this. Is there are issues that you are aware of that this can lead to needs to know regarding our country and the inability of us to get projects done speciate is something that council and is stated in policy were low hanging fruits so is there something we need to know that you haven't shared with us yet that hinders the department to implement policy. Going to speak in open session so advice that you know. I not aware of anything I'm not an expert on the country water system I believe director Taylor was speaking of. The Creole some. From a former settlement. Some type of legal matter but. I believe he said that was an older issue I'm not aware of anything currently at all thank you. Thank you for that. You're getting the fifteen million misplaced. Thank thank you very much Mr Chair and. I share also to white frustration you know I'm a lifetime a country resident third generation and we have you know gone through this normal water normal water since we could understand what Potter was or how you got it or whatever and so I understand you know the frustration but in the case of this particular appropriation I don't want to punish the people that could use this water or possibly get more water or protect the. If we were to do this because I'm frustrated so I don't want to be the reason why is this what it. Doesn't get expanded and we don't use the water that's been given to us a lot to us so I don't know if this is going to. Be their problem because we haven't been able to solve it now and this and my frustration is this was something that was proposed to us and we should have done it for the Years ago when we didn't have to for. Mr Coach Yeah. Given Mr White's comments I would like to see if we can bring Mr Taylor back up because it's my understanding that they're they're proceeding through the list not super fast but they are proceeding through the list. And a lot of people are saying well they can't afford the. Requirements to get the water to their place and I know in this bite. This could be an Miss Bice's committee or Mr victory no committee we're going to talk about fire flow because I think he told us Mr Taylor told us that sixty percent of the issue is fire flow if we reduce the fire for fire flow standards more meters can come. Right now without having to deal with the infrastructure being put in so. You know there are all kinds of extenuating circumstances and a lot of them are our our being the county's fault. You know regulations and whatnot so I thought that quite a few meters are gone out but that's what I was going to ask him what the number of meters that were going out. I wouldn't I would have asked them before I got on that with a calls to my office not enough to ease the calls to my office understood that a lot of that is structure or fire flow that we understand and we understand. Thank you Mr wait. Until you thirty three meters have been issued there are fifty more in process eight hundred applicants and who knows how many meters that eight hundred applicants this entails My problem with this is that we're spending. And I agree that the fire flow will help some portions of it but we're also in need of additional source of country to take care of the water meter waiting list so as Mr Taylor said we're hundred percent capacity up country that tells me he understands we need more source this money this fifteen million dollars is providing new source so I have a problem when it's like we said earlier with the. Department of Public Works looks at which roads to pave snacks and go to the ones that have the biggest problems so I just have a problem spending fifteen million dollars creating more source where there's adequate source now he said himself when with this is done we can stop pumping one well it's two wells I'm not sure what it what about maybe a combination of a couple of wells but then we can stop pumping well we don't have that capacity up country and until we start. Start looking at developing adequate source we're not going to solve the problem of the water meter waiting list. Thank you for your thoughts myspace. Trying to present both sides of this. I understand from discussing this with Director is. In the twenty year plan. Something that's going on right now and there's so many of these things I'm really sorry apologize for not being much more informed but so it's something I'm learning but I do know that he's trying to do something and we could ask him what that is and I know it's going to help. Also he did you know at one point we were offered and it was our decision not to take it and there's a lot of controversy about whether we should or we shouldn't but we had an opportunity and we didn't take it so we could ask Mr Tito if there were no objections I just want to be fair. Members. Mr Taylor if you would please rejoin us. If your. Question is posed by a misplaced. I thank you Mr Chairman myspace I think the core of the question is what are we doing for a country right now yes OK we probably put more effort into up country in the last few years in any other single area a lot of it is not the projects maybe that people are envisioning but it's projects that are helping First of all the focal Wells came online and that's the main basis of wire issuing meters now. That meter issues will go on slower than we like but for you know they'll certainly be several hundred meters offered We've also replaced the high lift pumps at Kamali so we can pump more of the water when there is water to higher elevations keep the ditches to keep the reservoir full keep the Piolo reservoir full OK That also will increase reliable capacity the next thing we're doing that that's kind of hard to explain is a project we've been working on for three years that is going to. Allow us to use the the why can more reservoir system and more efficiently with a well so that we have more water on an annual basis which will balance the ups and downs and be equivalent to having more source without getting in all the technical details the public Helliwell runs less than twenty percent of the time when I came in and looked at that and people are saying we need another well the same way you look at us and say well you only spent twenty percent of your money where you want more money we looked at the book Halliwell and I said it's only running twenty percent of the time. Why do we need another well why can't run that more and how to do with water quality at the upper level in the lower level disinfection systems that can't be mixed etc so. We ended up looking at how do we balance the water better how do we do this reservoir in drought rather than using the reservoir and then calling a drought which is what's been happening this ended up with a young lady from University of Central Florida getting her Ph D. In this she her Ph D. Thesis was how to do this Ph D.'s or original research no one knew how to do this so she published her Ph D. She's finished we know how to do it there's a chloramine disinfection station under design as we speak that will when it's finished when we build it it will allow us to mix the water better run. More of the time while we save the water from Taco Bell it's not sourced from the sense that we're not drilling a well or building a reservoir but if it is running more of the time over the course of a year that's equivalent to building a well of that size this is faster cheaper. Better permit lists and that's something we've been working on for a couple of years it is our suit that I'm not going to call it low hanging fruit each book was our low hanging fruit is our mid-level fruit and we've also got people working on the long term solutions of actual more source they're not right yet like you know as we're working simultaneously on all the areas certain things are ripe before other things but this upcountry balancing system is so complicated but we've been working on it nonstop for a few years it was so. I guess difficult that the National Water Research Foundation funded half of the effort because it was such a unique problem that no one knew how to solve it so even they contributed half the money to actually help solve the problem so I know the public tends to see as drilling a well or building a reservoir is the only two things that work but they're not optimizing the system to have more water on an annual basis available will also give meters so with that when that gets finished with the wife and we flew in finished which brings water more of the time the ups and downs will balance at a higher level that's equivalent to a well of a certain size we won't know until we get it done run it through a year to see how the seasons go but that is going to also give meters I don't know how many but there is no question that is going to raise the capacity of that system so. Again very difficult of a ribbon cutting ceremony on a Ph D. Thesis and a few small you know chemical feed pumps here and there but that's who we are we're out of the box we're leaving no stone unturned we're trying to do what we can right now while the longer term solutions that are going to take a little longer are worked on so sorry for the long answer but it is a very complex system. Thank you Mr Taylor now you know I couldn't answer that question. It's the whole thing you have to study and learn but the other thing. We do is that we're doing in what Resources Committee. Very hard because one of the big meters has been cost and so we're trying to do it how we can lower that cost and we have some innovative ideas and we'll be bringing some first possible consideration by the committee very soon thank you this place I'm dismissing coach and I understand Mr White's frustration I believe and this vices and. It's very understandable I would like to ask Mr Taylor that if we channeled all the money to a country for this year what could you do differently or more to get the source going or get more capacity a country. I think what we've exposed that maybe wasn't talked about before is there's the core system that we would build source transmission means storage you know the score system and there's this whole secondary problem of getting the pipes to the people who need it and I'll just call them equal values of roughly one hundred million dollars each I think we've talked about that and. Those are just good planning numbers to use we could pipes are pretty quick you can survey and get pipes in pretty quickly. The main source issues are tied to the source water availability State Water Commission contested case issues there are ongoing legal. Legal proceedings that we are involved in and it is going to be very difficult for us to excel or rate those ahead of the natural cycle of some of the contested case hearings and the hydrogen ology that doesn't yet exist so what we're trying to do is do the raw science that leads to the environmental impact statement that will need to get through this contested case and the Water Commission rules so that's what we're working on now again it's a long domino you know. Process. With all the money in the world I could not start drilling in the next three years and that's the bottom line I mean there is nothing we could do that would allow us to start drilling wells within three years so that's why I'm concerned about just putting money in all the money in the world is not going to get us permits through the State Water Commission and I believe assure us that passes muster in the next three years. OK Well that. You know then the question to the members would be do we stop everything until we wait for that or do we continue and do other things we can do so that's my thought thank you. Thank you so you mentioned that you have with the vocal Well you can issue several hundred meters let's call it three hundred. That's a I think that's a good working number right now what's the capacity of the sustainable capacity of that book of wells or the capacity with redundancy The is just over a million gallons. Well you know three hundred meters there with is. Connected so that you can pump into it no no you cannot there is no way to pump water into caulk about it just comes from the dam and the flume get you mention a booster pump to pump water into. The booster pump pumps water into the holo. Fifty million gallon reservoir at the mid level to keep that full So what was what was the. Are you planning to connect. The Isn't that the larger one that's the larger one at this point. That is not in the near term plan but it is something that we we certainly have penciled out as a possibility of of possibly. Building a system that could pump water and fill that it's. We're not. We're not at the point of doing actual preliminary engineering report of that but it is something that is certainly physically feasible because my recollection you've been talking about that for years about about connecting or putting in connections a pump into the reservoir so the that we're using a well to a greater degree to. Level off. The supply what we've been talking about and I know it's hard for me to explain we've been trying we've been talking about changing the disinfection system at the upper system so that we can use it whenever we want to save it for the drought basically shut it off run the wells for the lower elevations save the water at the high elevation for the drought pumping the water all the way to four thousand feet and storing it there is not something we've seriously seriously penciled out what we have been trying to do is this idea of talked about about changing the disinfection saving it for the drought. OK So you said you can't put a number on the. Process of saving the what you just said you can't put a number of meters to that. They would just be such rough guesses it's it has to do with the ups and downs of what's coming in from the flume Plus how we can best juggle this water limits of certain pump stations and that's also a reason why some of the pump stations are under designed for upsizing so we can juggle water around different levels there's a lot of the a lot of this is internal constraints within the reservoir and the pumps to pump and balance the water so what we recognize with the ups and downs of upcountry water. The rainy season the dry season if we can balance that better it sort of balances at a higher level and it's the internal bottlenecks of moving water around which are some of the reliable capacity limits which is the term in trying to switch you rather than source reliable capacity takes into account source plus your Plus your infrastructure ability. So can we give that process fifty new meters. I would guess that that is a very safe assumption I would certainly hope it would be much higher. So much higher is one hundred or two hundred I'm just trying to get a sense of it it could be it could be five hundred I don't I don't want to commit a number now and then be told later that you know it's less than that I I just don't know but it could be a significant amount OK and then. Just simply returns us to where we should have been or where we were before. That's not a net gain. You know you're not able to issue more meters based on walk away because that's just like the way it was there before you disrepair it well the flume was leaking so much for so many years again what we'll do is we'll run this out for a year or two and if it turns out that the reservoir levels stay at a much higher level that becomes reliable capacity they've given in meters OK And you can assign a number to that no account of meters so even if we use the if we take the three hundred from from Poco and then the two or three hundred from the balancing where six hundred meters four and I miss another thing that you've done that's going to create additional meters and I think the things we just talked about are are there things right now OK So we're looking at maybe maybe four hundred maybe five hundred maybe six hundred. That's probably a reasonable number could certainly be a thousand but I don't know and you stated the other night that there's nowhere else on the island has a wait list and you're not aware of any place else I don't know who that has a wait list that's correct so. I understand the need down here but what I what I think the folks up country also don't understand is how the how they're ever going to get ahead I understand you may not be able to drill for three years but I'm having a difficult time understanding how we're ever going to get ahead on this. We're frustrated too and I can tell you that that's why it's been such slow going for decades it is not something that anyone has ever figured out a way to just throw some money at and fix it is. Enormously complicated what I can say is we're up to nine hundred ninety nine on the list probably in this go around we'll probably get to you know two thousand two thousand and one so I had a test fire this morning say we've been waiting twenty years I think anyone who signed up hasn't been waiting longer than sixteen years at this point which is unacceptable I mean that's you know that's unacceptable to me. But a lot of people said this problem has been going on for you know decades and decades to be precise the decades old problems have been solved and a new problems have been added to it so we're people we're working on now and people who signed up in one thousand nine hundred nine these things might take us to you know I don't know two thousand and three or two thousand and five but that's it it's going to be slow going but again we're committed We've think we've got a lot further in the last four years then you know for a long time before that. Well I would say something else but all bite my tongue and thank. You in the questions for the Rector healer director Taylor think you want to get through assisting the committee thank you Mr. Chair Yes ma'am sorry. I have a question for Mr. LEGAL type question if you can assist because he's a county guy and state so in regards to director Taylor's comments about losing the water allocation for the now. That can happen. Thank you chair. I don't I don't know off the top of my head I was not familiar with that but I believe director Taylor said. It wasn't necessarily going to be if you don't use it soon you'll lose it his fear is that if we don't use it it'll get reappropriate or something by some other type of action so it might it doesn't sound like even he's anticipating it being like a legal challenge I'm sorry it's not a legal rule right now or. Something in the agreement it's his fear of a future action so hope that helps thank you thank you Mr. Thank you. I support your recommendation and that comment I know can strike fear in people but it took a long time for these how the cases the vet through the court system it takes time for it to get reversed as far as I'm not sure any but as far as I can see having been watching these thirty years so I'm comfortable with your recommendation. In the other comments. In this project. We have consensus no we should return and take a vote in the next round of. Seventeen twenty eight county weight upgrades and placements restricted strick good money any issues. Consensus. We can come back to this and get ready for vote in the next round. Seven hundred thirty four Kearney a country for protection reduction two hundred. One point five million is. Not exactly excited but I can. Be OK with this. Thank you. Mr I was just curious was that just a specific piece of the project or you just think they can do it cheaper with. Water . I believe that was just a reduction consistent with how the chair has been reducing other projects to address cost overruns. Was. Always basically for. Your comments we have consensus members in terms of the move forward so. If you can again this is the committee or. This. Reduction. And you Mr This was a project that was proposed in F Y fifteen as well which the committee elected to delete. The chair proposed to delete this project as well. Any more information on the project thank. You Mr Goodman thank you specifically. All right no. Actually what is what is the specific project that was done to lead. This project to start twelve inch water line along Baldwin Avenue. For enhanced fire protection I believe just upgrade the existing to upgrade. I think. You know this is a another project that I would normally support but the reason we needed it last year and the reason that I'm comfortable leading in the again is that they already have a. Pipe there now. And again my concern is focusing. Improvement money's up in the up country area or elsewhere. So I'm OK with this deletion key members misplaced. Have a recollection of what this was about and I remember discussing it with Mr Taylor when we were talking about how to spend the money that we have an issue in the budget at twelve point six mil and one of the reasons why we're looking at Put taking care of this twelve inch water line and put you know that so folks who want to connect it will not have to spend so much to connect because they're already a larger line there. Thank you you for coming members of consensus consensus. Keep moving forward you know no basis no OK Mr Chair on that one. You said. Yeah it's the white yeah. Yes we're it's just the way part of the central system so that's why I see the system the system is. OK doesn't make yes. To for this is your district Mr is it Mr White's district OK. See. Order for an unrestricted. Her for a commanded one thousand five hundred two million. Gardenias source transmission stories for order meter we list you heard comments from the director. Mr Coach thank you you know I think the comment was all the money in the world can't fix this yet so I mean we can put it there but it's just going to sit sounds like. So I. You know I defer to the up country folks to talk about that. It's a place thank you very much. As was suggested we might want to move some of the other items that we were thinking of taking out into this or taking out a deer and putting it into the projects that we would like to restore that don't have funding and that way we wouldn't have as big a number here and I understand the frustration and oh my god we want to give you money and you're saying you can use it it's been it was my reaction but I'm beginning to really understand how complicated it is we can say here is nine million dollars but then the director says OK we have to do is we have to purchase land we have to do studies we have to do this so it might take three years before we can do something like maybe ten years and so now I'm beginning to understand why this is such a complicated process I don't like it but that's the way it is and I don't know how to change it well if they don't start every get it going so sometimes you have to start we are going to kick start this process I don't want X. Tired of the excuses. That we are going to if have to force keep this project in to. Us We cannot let it get worse and I get worse. Play any very seriously to make sure that this county can respond and. You know respect to misplace with and I understand there is great complexity one of the issues of why we don't have the connected system. But. Status quo is not good enough which are doing nothing as to what this is all. Your are you. As I think you can tell I'm I'm happy sitting on this money but we can create a C.F.P. Fund like it in the waste water and end of this year if they haven't done anything of country that it will go into the sea it can lapse into the fun and that's with. A coach Thank you Mr Chairman and you know I'm fine with with doing that if that's the will of the body that's fine but. I do have an objection to not doing nothing you heard up there that they're not sitting around not doing nothing. It's not as fast as we would like but. And you also heard that you know all the money in the world they can't get things going they're doing what they need to do as the steps go on a lot of this has to do with the consent decree which was I think. I have a different opinion on that one. And sometimes our hands are tied. And so you have we need to know Mr Coach Martin you know something we need to know this far as what consent decree you just mentioned there's a lot of stuff on the sentence consent decree that we can't bring out in exam in open session it's my understanding that is in most time your career. But if the basis of this is because a concerned no no I'm saying the basis of denying this or reconsidering this is that you heard the directors say this is what we're doing not nothing but we're doing something and all the money in the world and I just want on the record and all the money in the world isn't going to fix this right now we're doing what we can do within the parameters that they can operate and so. Just put nine point five nine point six million dollars in a pot to sit there. I don't know. Again and again. I appreciate your comments Mr Coach which I just feel they can do better. In space thank you very much chair Jack just want everybody to understand that I have had. Basically not even four months as chair of water to figure out what was on first and who's on second. And to learn a little bit more about the technical side of development you know as a public person I felt exactly like people you know what's the problem why don't we do it come out let's go and all this stuff but then when you begin to get more involved you begin to understand that there's a much bigger picture here then we get I want more I'm just like everybody else I want to solve the problem I'm tired of it like everybody else but I don't see the alternative rather than taking the steps and doing the things that have to be done in order for us to get some where we want to go which is everybody having water and everybody having the meter that they want and so I'm willing to go along with the steps that it takes to get there however I do believe that we need to pay a lot more intense attention to water I think it's you know being the number one issue because it affects everything else I think we need to put more attention on it we need to talk about it you know on it and demand more what are you doing how are you doing it and I think it's important that we we put the light on it and I think that's where you're going and unfortunately this is involved in budget I wish we were having this discussion at another time but we are here thank you for all the different a different feel you know hearing over to scream at you that we can do more in storage explaining storage capacity. I hope they don't get narrowing your perspective or what if you can and cannot do that you know willing to look at it from the sixty's and then the mayor's code while you're in your pocket book crim tree or a storage that I can remember from the sixty's. I was and. Still talking about stories for up now it's fifty is. This car you think it's here and I appreciate you know what you're saying and how you want to guide or urge or force the hand of the department to do what you know you feel is right and I and I agree with storage big time. And so I mentioned earlier and director was here that this is the pot of money that I wanted to utilize one hundred forty seven thousand five out of to reinstate a few of the watershed grants. And my justification is due to his comments it will just sit but I understand where you're coming from and you said you know we direct it to where we put the money is where we're going to guide the departments and what have you to utilize and I guess I just felt a little burned in the last budget where I had proviso of certain things in. Specifically to be used by department and yeah it was against their will but I felt if I provide as a way and word it specifically for what I want to use for this for my community it would get done it never got done and so here I am this budget round trying to figure out a way and think God for you know nonprofits who want to assist and do the partnership thing that it's going to work this time around but it didn't work with the proviso even so. I understand but I just hope that it's not going to. Hinder possibly the use of one hundred forty seven five out of this pot that's just coming right out your thank you. Yes I'll be open to that thank you very much consideration. So hearing that. You know at least missing. From this. So let's go seventeen one seven five six only wait for the improvements order from unrestricted cup for a million dollars appropriation zero. What improvements were. You know if you notice the committee he's famous chair this program is to. Basically address projects that come in higher than expected or cost overruns and the like a fat bank but you just asked to have one right up above the line before so I don't know but somehow you know what it's going to be used for. I don't need contract. Slush fund of billable peed off. There's a difference for the chair and it's a level of trust in the Department. Forty million dollars that I don't have at this point in time. Consensus No we can return. Again waterfront so. Please look at the rates because the story means you go to Frank cash. Replacements Mr Chair Yes Mr Miss Cochran had a question and then I have one after that before we go further I think Mr COUCH Actually it's more of a comment and there's a couple items in here in reference to west so my head office called director to get specifics if any. Truly as you state it can't be broken down per say dollars for this next model is for that but it is in the general vicinity of these items that are listed here and so I am comfortable chair with your recommendation and. But at this point I'm comfortable thank you I think in the comeback this a coach Thank you Mr Chairman you mentioned rates just because we have seen so many numbers did you or did you not. Propose increase keeping the marriage rates or bring him back down I know the meter development fee but I don't know what about the other. With you on this one. You know. It's a chair simile No thank you your proposal includes. Keeping all water rates and water development flat fifteen levels Thank you OK Well Mr Chair This is Mike on that would you do it now or at RE time but. You know. And I'm not sure if you've been a member of the water. Committee. But I've seen Mr Taylor Choa chart three or four times in the last four years five years now four and a half years that says you know we got to raise the rates this much and we have a controlled crash of our system across controlled failure of our system the rates this month's were status quo if we raise the rates this month then we can improve our system everybody in the room which is that least seven of us here well six because Mr Victor no one here has said yes that's a great idea and then yet when it comes to. Implementing it every last two years we have not done it. I'm just trying to remind members that if we expect them to do something we've got to give them the funds there's a plan a twenty year plan that we've seen like I said three or four times and everybody agrees agreed to it and yet we don't feel that we need to. Implement it so I'm just just frustrated. The way things are going thank you. Now they appreciate that comment in your frustration Mr Coach just so I understand it. Part of rate increases because you deserve it because you've been able to perform OK for me to my satisfaction OK And I've said on what I Committee. And that's why it's all that lets us be part of the employment determination process we are definitely involved water. Is the White Cock OK well this place thank you very much it's kind of a chicken and egg here you know if we don't give them the money they can't do it and we don't give them the money and they don't do it and we say well you know very well and so and I you know you're absolutely right I think. Maybe enough aids that you never performed when I was budget you know this thing I remember doubling c.a.p doubling hundred percent increase maybe twenty percent that's a different department. Than it is four years ago. No different director Stu I went to a director's different styles from Sam I thought I was so great I've seen the gamut understand that but we finally had somebody here who gave us a plan who espoused a plan. And. We're not. Only me but then again just get ready for the What's because that's how it is going to be settled OK. I just texted my staff have we received the. Analysis by the Department of the various county What a development rates are they're going to do a comparison between our water system development fees and those of the other counties. Let's check this check our records and we'll get back to you I think you didn't. Respond back to you missed the wait on the requests Thank you. Kate that ends the review over own. Everything else will be revisited. Seven hundred sixty I think we were discussing seventeen fifty seven and various and we're going to vote on yes yes OK. So. I think your comments seriously Mr Couch and and so I'm going to see my proposal is based on the existing rates so for Water Fund we're going to need to look at the rates understood. Revenues quickly. Is there any areas Mr Bush. Need some additional comment. Mr Chair We never went through the most part of me we never went through those revenue No but we're going to go through it now OK. It's Abbas any comments. You want to highlight regarding revenue. The needs to be addressed this there was one item in the different page sixty eight line one thousand and twenty four in your. Chairs details that was a deletion of this healthy aging partnership empowering elders grant revenue the department had notified the committee that the white Health Connector the one right above it was being not being received but this healthy aging partnership was being this received so I was unsure if that was just a mistake you know oversight or if that was an intention of the chair to believe that. In that grand revenue were huge page sixty eight line number one nine hundred twenty four or. It's on the page there's no notice changes but on the chairs details. On the cuts it's listed there is a cut. Which when you. Use your Schumer can you assist us it's a chair this was a position for a wellness cordon eater and it was a limited term appointment for two years. And I. Think the department. I'm not sure if this was one of them that they were not sure they were going to get the grant along with. Qwest and the Hawaii Health Connector ground. So your understanding is this is going to be received this is the one. That you were here but maybe the committee might remember Miss Stone walls Deborah stone was testifying. Regarding this one too to. Ask that it be restored. There was a I think. She was concerned that fringe benefits weren't being covered by this grant but they are if you look at the budget details for this one it's budgeted for in code six to seven five which is going to benefit costs you think you. Sort of connector at the. Fringes and so we receive yes they do all the new office and aging grants we always are now budgeting for those fringe benefit costs the Health Connector What was the one that she had mentioned that we have not received the funds yet and so the likelihood of receiving those funds was quite low so I could understand the committee chairs. Proposal to delete that one if we do get it we could come back for a budget and. You heard the budget director comment Any thoughts members. You know in a resort yes. Store that's not an issue for the CIO This is our money making and this is limited. And the funding of fringe is with us is the chair of areas. Any other areas Mr. You'd like to us to look at these we did have a revisit on the timeshare ventures there was a question regarding the proviso This is page seventy two items number twenty forty six. There provided that the funds shall be used for three tennis courts one parcel five in West Mali. Weren't quite sure what parcel five was. OK thank you I would leave this. Part of the time to a nation Yes Mr Cho you're correct that the timeshare donation is part of their S M A permit S M one two thousand six zero zero one similar to the public works one that was received recently he. Worked with the. Parks Department to see a specific bit more specific. Or some other identification that who gave you the appropriate information that would be helpful I will be calling the Parks Department during the break as well to discuss the other items discuss this as well thank you. Mr Cochran and also director. Besides the question about where parcel five is to be used for the public yeah that's I mean I just want to make sure. Make sure that it's be a public improvement that we would be doing so yeah I assume because it's not kind of written clear here to say that in a sense but so just so we. Thank you Mr Cochran Mr coach and that's part of my concern to Mr Parshall five sounds like it's a parcel in their complex and if it's in the middle of their complex I don't know how many people for the public or even to know it's there so I'm a little concerned about that with the Department for a site that also Mr COUCH to thank you better clarity. Thanks so that for the committee's information thank you for that. Any. For us to. Consider I believe that it's for grand revenue that was the. Only items that I had as a revisits thank you very much. Page eighty one members. So. I'm sure you will receive your communique from the Humane Society. On their. Hundred fifty thousand. And if I recall correctly and I'm paraphrasing because they don't have the document from me that they mentioned something to it a contract signed an agreement on what this fun could be used for and they're saying that I or. Two hundred fifty thousand from this fund is not within their contract agreement. So I would say a while and with that Mr Will you had a chance to look at the response from we humans who say the way I read The country is they cannot ask for anything and last within the agreed upon agreement of those permitted areas of agreement from this site to the county for use of this fund I don't believe it's. The council has the authority over the course and. An actor is Chapter. From making use yes Mr Coach I'm reading the actual code that they quoted her right thing so we the county have put that restriction on them now because the code doesn't restrict and that's why Mr COUCH I just explained it from the perspective I view the contract that within this fund that we're talking about now it limits what society can ask from the county right. From the county I don't see this in any way restricting the council from making appropriations fund the fund because he doesn't the limitations of the permit of use of the funds. I believe is still within council jurisdiction that we can make this consideration so I'm going to miss missed it. If the chair is incorrect in his understanding of the code used to. Thank you I am in general agreement with you as long as you guys use the money for the purpose set forth in chapter three point four or I should say use the money but appropriate the money for purposes. In accordance with Chapter three point four I don't see any restriction on the this body appropriating funds from this fund thank you so that's why I brought it up because if we did have a response that challenges or questions if it is appropriate. Yeah and I don't have any doubt that it's appropriate for this body the question is the contract they signed that the account that the Department of Housing and human concerns. Says limit it limits it to one time use and it listed a list of things on what basis I don't know but that's what the contract they signed by they going to break their contract are we telling him that they can break their contract according to the the email we got it Mr. I know you don't have the contract in front of you so if you shoot too. If I'm a chair Mr will generally speaking I believe this isn't them asking you guys for an assignment this is the council utilizing this fund to pay for. County services which are part of this grant the contract whatever you want to call it so I don't see a problem with it I don't imagine this would be a violation of the terms of conscious is a different funding source as is the right of this Council thank you and I'm fine with that my I mean. They are given instructions by the county saying that as long as animal management funds are available these funds shall be used for the following one time only costs that's what they've been told by the county are we are we telling them that they don't have to worry about that. OK with telling him that I'm just saying I can see where they're going wait a minute one portion of the counties don't want to be violated I understand that but I don't see them for leaving the country it's not them doing the requests. Thank you Mr Boss brought up a very good point this contract that you're speaking of I believe it expires on June thirtieth this new funding source becomes effective July first twenty week and fifteen so I'll make sure I work with the department of housing concerns to clean up this language Thank you. Thank you Charlie I think you're right we were. Within our rights to appropriate the money and the money is is it says as long as we're using it for animal management and I don't think by appropriate in this for purposes of funding their operations that we're putting them in any kind of a questionable situation because we're taking the money out there not that they're not the ones that are requesting it so I think it can still consistent with their contract if they're requesting money themselves to replace a vehicle or whatever that these are the guidelines they need to follow so I don't I don't think your decision is inconsistent with their contract at all and I would just say that the church. Of the council would limit. Of the for granted or of other powers given by its charter. The Council shall have a member too to legislate appropriations for county purposes subject to the limitations provided by this charter there is no limitations on this fund. So without limitations of the powers of this document our constitution allows this body to move this consideration for. So I just want to bring it up because it was brought up in communications Yes And so I just wanted to make sure that I believe you we are within our purview to continue to move this consider shing forward if we so desire to see Coach Yeah and I certainly agree with that. Another side that was listed in there and salsa listed in one of the provisos and has been for years and it may be time to remove it but there's a limitation on them buying tasers. OK because they've been they've had their officers I assaulted understand a safety issue that Mr Chairman general understanding is only law enforcement officers are authorized to carry. Forth they are not law enforcement officers Thank you you for a corporation counsel and he was very firm in his. Response to the committee. Is there any other. Mr Bush. Done no no no I was just going to keep moving through this OK you have a specific area and in this particular section chair. So you're looking you put this in there one hundred fifty this is your language or this administration so this is coming from the chair OK and. The tests Mr Bryant they had been up here and mention after hours services and want to some type of funding for that service can that come out of this section. And I can't recall the dollar my I don't think it's was huge forty seven or something thousand. Of any comments you want to share. Yeah I guess better understanding of maybe that the committees or the chairs. Movement of these funds from the animal management program are you also. Deleted the expansion request and then moved one hundred fifty that was a net difference OK so if that's the case then you have requested a twenty five thousand dollars was the evening. Nights and weekends service was a part of my reduction. Mr Chair for me sushi more for animal enforcement the expansion that they had requested was. Depleted and an additional one hundred fifty thousand dollars was. Shifted from the animal management fun or animal. In in the Department of Housing human concerns. And shifted to this animal management revolving find so I get fifty thousand dollars was the get there and move here and it's twenty five thousand dollars for the night the overnight service. Discussion. And the reason and I heard some comments from other members here in regards to that particular service and I have firsthand knowledge that. Actually one of my staff had a incident where she needed the service and couldn't afford it. There's a charge for. What so they may not ask us for any money to provide services but they charge the client or a person who's asking for their overnight services so that's why it's for this amount of everything of the four company the group can do a job that will provide services company wide for people thank you thank you. Do any of the comments I've not heard that by our makes any charges have an M.O. You with the police and they're out there all the time. I've never heard that they charge for anything. Interesting to find out what that was. And they it's interesting that they request from the Humane Society for night service is an exact amount of the amount that we had. Tried to provide to buy OUR to offset some of their expenses and their time. Was a coach. Yeah I was about ready to say you know if this other if I R is providing the service for free why are we paying for. The Humane Society to do it but now I'm. I mean first and second hand knowledge. That that is. A little bit of a different story now if there are actually charging people to do it but I would think if they have a name or you with the police department they can't charge but who knows. That would be very interesting to find out from by our themselves because. Her staff member was told it would cost. You keep but for this area is do we have consensus on that one fifty from this revolving fund. And just keep think you . Know was there to revisit the open space FUND Yes. Now or wait yeah what would you like that you had to consider but I believe Mr Somebody had a question on. The first one number one adjustments for certification no land acquisition subject to for. Morris point which. When there is no movement so again I don't know what is the exact status as a negotiation as I know we had discussions with the property owner who are working on trying to come to a agreed on amount. This is something that previous committees did do site inspection so some of us know exactly where this is. Where it's missing out of a follow up but I think this is part right this would be coming up under parks Yeah . Mr Q Mr bus Thank you actually the mayor's office has taken over this negotiation and. The I did confirm with. Mr Capello had mentioned the other day that the negotiations have stalled completely. And. No it was a suggestion of maybe one of the members to delete this we have to come back for a resolution anyway and so if it's up to the committee to you know to delete this would be fine and we could come back for a budget amendment with the resolution if it's so it's up to the committee chair Yes QUESTION When was the last. Negotiations what. I believe. The last real negotiations were approximately two years ago. The last discussion. From from my conversation was was a couple months ago they tried again but not reaching any kind of agreement on price is it just you know agree men are that are not willing to. Be part of the negotiation. Yeah I would like to have that clarified sure does if. The landowner is but you know. I could provide some speculation to the response that I heard but I can imagine that. For this maybe you can check on that to formalize it for me at this point as like you know. That's my advice that. From what I heard that the the price was at a point where it seemed like that the landowner was not interested in selling it to us at all yeah. You can. Make it your thank you so we'll wait feedback for you Miss. Novella on this. In a handout from Mr P. Go over staff and Mr Chair just wait on the bottom leave Number two was. Proposed by you to be removed and I think at least chaired by so one I'm a chair Mrs. Member by. Was concerned about it and I think I am to number two. Line twenty three twenty four. You know I don't recall eliminating this project. Or Miss chair this was. Eliminated because of the use of the fun that's right this was recommended to do not use open space finally for this consideration of acquisition it was for I believe from either the partment or Corporation Council they gave us advice on two considerations it was for the gym and this that they were commanded that we look at different another funding source Oh not from this space fun. To misplace stuff. I read. Pinion that was referred to. And I like does mostly OK you can tell us a little bit more about it when I read it I don't get the I don't get. Understanding that he has of course you know again we're at Binions so. I don't know that it's prohibited to use this money for those for both of them. If you would please. Thank you Mr Chair Mrs by so it was a matter of its interpretation. I guess if you viewed it as an improvement for access into certain facilities abroad reading of that which is allowed under the open space fund you know you could definitely see how it's appropriate. But just generally under you know open space for recreational purposes outdoor type matters which the fund speaks of. The gym especially it's a little tougher to fit died in under their. Community Center a little different I'd say because I believe the community center property has. Its at the gate ball courts tennis courts tennis courts also and if I'm familiar with one that's a rather small community center actually but it's all up to how this council wants to do it you know it's a broad interpretation for the gym but it's eight could fit thank you. So the gym would fit under what. I believe we looked at it as an increase in access to a. Public facility or a public recreational area because although it is a private gym at this time chair. I believe for decades it's been used under the control and management of the county of the park in a park for creation Thank you. Misplace any additional comments at this time yes. This facility is. Where there aren't a whole lot of them in the area the whole community uses this facility it is in constant use by schools and by athletic folks and. It's very very important to that area because it's the only thing that we have and if it's gone then we'll be saying OK we want to new gym too like everybody else and I think it's it's got a lot of historic value as you mentioned it's been mentioned it's been there for a very long time and it also has a lot of nostalgic value because of the history of it so. People this is a priority for them I think we received a letter from the community association and this is it on their priority list. Any other comments. Sure Mr Chair I would support keeping in two and five if you know we got kind of a OK for counsel I would support doing that. I'm going to revisit this I'm going to see where we are in our numbers I might recommend another way. Thank you I'm not against the program requests I just. I mean you know me I'm very conservative in cautious with the people's money so I will look at other ways to. Say OK make this happen besides the open space Fund thank you. Not a promise by sight Mr quite. Yet I would I would agree with your sensitivity to this because. Just because we can fit something doesn't mean that it's a good idea. And so I would have I would really appreciate you're looking for other ways to. Make both of these projects happen and just from my understanding. Is it just the land that we're purchasing I understand getting the you know. Community Center of the center. I mean I mean I think we own the building I already believe we own the building already but the land is still the. Property and yes the underlying land is not owned by the county but the facility is our facility and what is the term of the lease believe it's one year one dollar a year but for how long how much longer. I could look that up yeah I'm not aware of the terms but if you get a good deal on the lease that maybe would or could issue which is that the but to the end of the lease and yeah consider well you know picking it up yeah I don't know what. You know what there is for this and burning interested. On temp seaside to do that right away but I think would be good for us as we look we're looking for other ways to fund this if it's if it's not a burning need to act on this this year it may give us another year or two to write to us to do something with it but I think I think we all agree that it's something . That should happen yeah I mean there's a lot of. Areas in the county. As a county for years but was owned by the ranch that we brought just. And I mean the Senate is the building we own the land is still. I'm looking at acquisitions because right now our P.P. Tells me it's valued at forty thousand dollars. So Mr Turner I could explain why the mayor did put this in initially if you'd like. We appreciate him putting in I think the challenge for the community is. To provide the funding to acquire it I think that's the challenge for the church is not whether or not we support the requests of the church is very open as I said earlier. I'm just willing to look at other ways to paying for it misplaced just to add some clarification my understanding is that this is land is now owned by. Because he bought the property from the it's part of that thing he wants to do the posing thing that we approved OK. But there are a number of years left on that I think the community is concerned because of the shift in. You know all of the possible complications they would like to own this so that there is no question and more so because we have put all the improvements on the property we have millions of dollars of improvement in that property because of the tech tennis courts tennis words we help. Us. Understand that they'd like that. OK OK OK thank you any further discussion on this if not but we are going to retrain because the chair would like to look at optional funding sources too for acquisitions. OK. Mr Moon Yes I think. I bombers are I'm sorry. Number four. Number three just that we're going to go down the list because the next of those three. Yes I have a comment in regards to that yes or to department or is there clear title on this. Thank you Mr Chairman. My understanding is this is the amount so we can go in to use our power for eminent domain we'll have to come back for eminent domain resolution to the council but at least we have the funding source to pay for it this way that nine point one acre parcel does not have clear title. I'm not supportive of this and I know the families that are there trying to claim so personally that's just my take at this point and. This is already in. Sorry I understand this is already been adopted by the council or this is the new requests. Mr Chair This is a new request I believe. So much better. So you want to revisit. This and I'm just not in favor. With that question I think you'd be able for me anyways if there's like a next to these when they were submitted into this fund because I know I've been sitting around a while like this and we weren't sure because the project itself has been around so yes you know I think I recall one. Just helpful anyways for future reference. Thank you thank you. Mr. Service for a number four. So we are. I'm calculating that right now for the approximate level of debt service for the fiscal year if you'd like to put that amount in. The other minute I just looked up the actual execution cost that was bonded in F Y fourteen bond issuance I think it was four hundred thirty four thousand chair staff looked it up a couple of months ago thank you. Yeah I think we need to at least under that description bracket what we're looking at for the fund. And. Anything number six I mean. Chair Yes This one was just kind of thrown in there without any discussion on it Mr Spencer came in and talked. About it a little bit. Is written response right I'm a little concerned. That if there are strings attached to this. If we if we don't if we buy it does that mean we have to let him do the development there. Mr. Thank you Mr. I believe we still need to come back to counsel for acquisition on there are three point four four under all. Even if you put the money in here you'd still get to review the documents and see what type of agreement has come to OK thank you chair then I would be supportive of Certainly getting this. From the perspective being reviewing the. Birds laid out in their proposal it looks like he is with us to consider for a strip. We don't seem to talk. Is that supposed to be their way of selling us something that will be part of the drainage system because I would not accept if we're going to flow from the development of our open space right to ridge right because that is going to get attention it Corps of Engineers require a pool right and it shouldn't be the county's job. Is to be used for the projects to vote regarding mitigation for drainage and flood I totally agree but I wasn't clear it is interesting that I can know enough about plans reading plans that there was stuff right now the area I mean to it it just comes down there so I'm looking how to how to lean out there on both sides of the open space and I'm . A drainage control. Project. This. Thank you for your observant insight and I wholeheartedly agree and you know I understand we're all like communities coming with this they've been trying to work in conjunction with the developer in this area because it really impacts and as. We in all this downsizing so he's been appeasing that it's that community as that as he can and I guess with the areas that you're describing Hey colony what you do this for open space and AG and all those wonderful glorious things the community wants and be the good guy and put money in our pockets so I mean I don't blame a person for wanting that in their behalf but I understand your concerns and so I'm in favor of not pushing this one forward my thing is we will have our opportunity more than likely it will be a mystic Keros committee because he needs to get entitlement approvals from Combs and then we can get like the other project. The public community benefit from the project and if appropriate we can make a condition of zoning regarding this site also as another way of approaching. This request so you know again not seen that that was in everything but just the you know how it's being. Conceptually. Might work with an eight projects and some others that's the first thinking in my brain is we've been used for a drainage project Mr coach so and I totally agree with the due diligence in doing that I don't see any reason to pull it out because they like Mr Holder said there's going to be several different. Things that they would have to do before this even being close to being sold this would signal our attention to all right we're open to a discussion. I would reduce this to one thousand dollars it's fine if you want to keep it as a placeholder but not at this time or come in that we agreed to the two point one million dollars. So you hear the chairs proposal that we have consensus and census Thank you. Mr Goose. Mr Chair Yes Mr So for item number for debt service for the purchase of approximately hundred acres of the new pool for the fiscal year two thousand and fourteen bond issuance we utilized four million two hundred twenty eight thousand and one hundred seventy dollars and bond. An approximate calculation of. Two hundred seventy five thousand dollars and in debt service for fiscal year sixteen. Thank you for that. I might ask Mr Chair for could at least round up to three hundred thousand just in case my calculations are not exact. Will put estimated that three hundred think you. Any objections to that members no objections Thank you OK This consensus is it for. Number one we'll await MS to give us some comment and by the chair we can look at alternative funding number three we'll revisit it. With C. . Or any other. Program. I want to continue to provide that million for the planing engineering of the land I mean affordable project freeze one Mr we out of the open space fund. Yes Oh no I was I was are we do have a proposal I have. I have to Mr Goodman thank you Chad I'm sorry Mr. I am sure all the members are very well very well aware of the different all the testimony that has come in the last couple of weeks as well as the one thousand seven hundred thirty four signatures on the petitions. Proposing and requesting that a line item be inserted for the grant just for the land acquisition for. And. Maui and I provided the numbers which. When you search on it on the maps on the on line you won't be able to get the team case. We specifically had to get those. From the department themselves because they're there behind it was recently subdivided and I have provided. In the packet a letter that I. Wrote to the representative of N.B.C. Even Robinson as well as having a conversation with him and Grant Chon attached to that letter is their advertisement of the properties. There is a lot for here that is not indicated in the advertisement but because when the advertisement came out it had not yet. The private owner had not yet released it for for sale so on the the background of these lots as you've heard from the testimony. That they're very sacred and they're very historical circle have a significance to them. If you look at the map that I'm providing to to you has it's been subdivided I'm going to walk you through the proposed T.M. Case here we're talking about two hundred sixty seven acres and I'm proposing three point two million as a placeholder just to allow for negotiations for the administration or for it possibly to to go through. If you look at a lot number. Of these six slots lot number two has been sold already a lot number six was also part of the land exchange with the private individual so a lot of them are six is not available therefore we're in my proposal I'm looking at lots number one three four and five and on the last page of the packet I've indicated. The significance of lots of one three four and five. And how they're the terrain is as well as the usefulness of those properties. And so I would humbly ask. The members to support this and you of course share to support this line item Thank you Mr Goodman for this consideration thank you so much. And community pain is a great culture yes. Do you know you've. Already using you know the women or the. Like go which is part of the drainage components of the development I do not know that but I can find out. A Lot Number one you can see it's kind of an odd shape because it goes so does a long title Coast yeah excuse me it's like an el Sheikh Yassin and then it goes along the coast here so that is a buddying lot five. Is that the good ones like anything yes yes and it's also a budding lot two and three great and very very. Lucky to have three and four get great exis up to a public property and I can on my my little chart of travel here I've listed. I believe a lot one has access to one a highway and let's see Lot Number three has also access road to one a highway and a lot for no no a lot for DOES NOT lot five is a nice flat area with some harsh sites on it but this is very if you've heard the testimony of the. Constituents that this is a very sacred areas that are along here and to keep it in preservation It's just keep and also leave I've heard from. Lucianne to name a few other people that the land trust could possibly be interested in this area as well Ellen I just don't get it is going to help provide money. I don't know I don't even get to manage the land for us. But I'm just asking for consideration and I know it may not happen it's just that if we don't put it in then yes you know understand I mean this is a good proposal Mr Koosman. Because of the archaeological and cultural. Sensitive components within the last year asking us for consideration and they get a chance to maybe reach out because one agency that does that money is. And if they would like maybe consider supporting part of the purchase especially for the protection of those cultural historical areas. Is that something you feel is sort of open to. Us as it was also stated merely Carol at a lot to do with this area. Mr Coach thank you I'd like to ask Mr he's up on this kind of stuff but it looks like according to a letter. Like this from Mr Good dated October tenth two thousand and fourteen that this can't be subdivided anymore yes because we have the sliding sliding scale Rice. In and we did make. Some subdivisions when we enacted the ordinance and I believe in one thousand. Nine hundred eight I remember so you know that any change just to ally the fears I would think of some of the testifiers today thousands of houses can't be built on here. It's. Not willing or able to make that assumption I don't know I'd hate to say something like that if I don't know thank you OK Mr Chair I'm very supportive of. Placeholder and. Worst comes to worse if we have to if we can only buy a lot one that's a fabulous lot but because of the the oceanfront area there are the bikes that actually most of it's cliff but I would see. How you can support a placeholder in the final commitment by council of this committee to actually purchase or acquire it yet that we are doing our due diligence and we are going to do due diligence to make sure that if we move forward it's based on sound information and if we don't it's based on sound information are you OK with it yes yes and I am just be happy. To say wait thank you I totally support this idea they would be great to get a hold of this property and. Just wish that the prior landowner had come to the county our first. Give us an opportunity to you know to do something with us earlier at probably a much much more reasonable price I'm not referring to the three point two million but the three point two million is obviously just a placeholder. But they would be fabulous if we could make this happen thank you I appreciate your comments very much anyone else comments on this consideration . Carry it well it's been very. Exciting to watch that testifiers and to see the passion you know it reminds me of some of the things we've done before in. Open space or you know a beach property or whatever and I think it's something that I would like to flesh out and if we can do it I think we should. Mr Barr. Are you we have some comment you'd like to share at this time. You know that. I believe you know we be interested in finding out more information definitely you know should a council put this in I would want to do our due diligence prior to any submittals back to council you know if it's the will of the body to put in whatever numbers in there be fine if you want to put in a small amount so that we can do some. Surveys and appraisals then maybe that might be appropriate as well. As. Members. And then we just rounded off the three million for and sure as a placeholder we don't have to three million for our. Actions Thank you. So we have consensus I'm thinking this is consent just. Add this to the consideration and there's the open space fund job Mr Thank you. Thank Yes thank you for the proposal and I wish you could make decisions like this when everything. So anything else in this area members if not. Under the Affordable housing. I again would like. Have kept that million dollars that we've been through in the support of the for the last few years Mr Turner project Mr and I think the question was not a certain leaving it in or not it was is that enough from your discussions with the . Well you know. Mr group working with the community to look at phase one phase one is a critical phase of course because this is the high end of the infrastructure. Projects. With the infrastructure costs it's. So the estimate of thirty million initially is something. The mayor and his team are reviewing to see if they can be some reductions and I just moments in the engineering and architectural so they've talked to the consultants to. Put this conceptual program together and I would be a believe their close to it thirteen to fifteen million dollar range for phrase one which is kind of basically in half but still being able to meet the needs of a phase one and infrastructure requirements for construction. Saying that part of it will require again as we've chatted before on this subject. With any additional funds from the annual real property tax. Revenue source as well as the potential or receiving some of the files if and when we sell the cool model project which is something that they you know we've had coming. As one way to approach and replenish the fund to do other projects so. I you know I appreciate Mr buy. So I was willing to go to a million but if you had to take pride chick. And I apologize for not checking with Mr. Ahead of time but if and not sure if you may need just a small amount additional floor to continue the design of the feet. Portion and then we becoming back definitely once that's near completion to request infrastructure requirements we come it's got to be spent on the project where it can be spent. Here in your comments and the members understanding it. Because this is one of the few affordable projects that we try to do internally. Members she ever any issues with doubling the amount. To two million dollars You know I've heard. Yet they were the project members so I would appreciate So can we have consensus on two million. In the Fund thank you up it to two million dollars for the and I affordable housing project. And a little more. Specific adjusted numbers to Mr and her team working with our community work force. Any issues with the employment Yes number. Not the number the fact that it's there. It's a special fund that we don't need anymore because we now have the ability to send it straight to the state that. I know you were talking about I want to have it go through council but you were talking about. You know doesn't making an ordinance to have it go July first immediately. You know we can do that but. Operationally you know Mr Buffett would see can you give us a little time in July first. So he the obvious first source of them but first is a more reasonable consideration in a new fiscal year to make those transfers but you know right now I prefer that we have it in the budget goes through the phone Council make. It has to go through council to get it to final. Position to be sent to the State Department currently. I prefer to we have the level of confidence that at least five will have a prayer for a wee bit this week and run it through counsel and the time you want to transfer and where we want to transfer and send it to the state it's an additional step but I want that peeper trail especially for external auditors. That's just my oversight hat on but those are my red tape classes that's all. And I appreciate that. But I think the community has come to a point where they appreciate us doing that kind of Billy the finance portion of this committee's responsibilities I mean you know so it's just a matter of process and procedure but I don't think this is an issue of whether or not we should pay our bills so I'm just saying that I prefer to keep it the way it is. Consensus you know. We can come back and vote on it Chair has to wait before we move on. In the open space fund. And like to see if we can clean up the language a bit different terminology we have grants and disbursements for land acquisition we have provided that shall be for appraisal and acquisitions and just land acquisition subject to chapter three point eight. We've had trouble in the past with. The presence of the words grants and distribution and disbursements. So I would I would like to recommend that we change the language to be consistent to start off with land acquisition. Grants and disbursements. For consistency in how we state things in the budget document just so they number two is more of a provide a. Return as a pro-choice. Project. I think we I would prefer that it all be worded Similarly the king with the staff will work with Mr Baez and Mr. Hu see what we can do and if anyone needs an explanation for the removal of grants and disbursements they can see me after class. No. Just land acquisition that's that's of the purpose of this fund. And Mr Chair I have no no problem with that I just thought was it two years ago that we we you know made the language all uniform and put it in OK. We took something we took something out OK that had that OK I'm fine with me so we'll work on it as a request by the committee that's fine. Fine yet Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair in my proposal I. Wanted to put language in there to essentially put back four of the five. Projects that we saw here that pretty much everybody liked. But it this way it allows us you know we wanted to separate them and the initiation didn't want us to this way it's my understanding for those five projects are still. Available and. I'd be I would like to put that proviso and I'll do that when it's time to do proviso but I just want to let the members know that that's. My thoughts OK thank you and thank you for being upfront and sharing that I'm going to see it as a as your chair I am not very supportive of this grant we're talking about evolving fun and I must be happy. You know we've given certain businesses when we already asking businesses to pay taxes to support and the business to have one fundamental issue with that. Especially when other business is helping to pay and we're going to give a grant now a loan from this fund and so. That is why. The proposal in committee is that being posted I don't support it so that when that son chain of the. From his chair so I'm just being upfront I'm going to be supportive of your proposal. Since you've been very upfront with what you want to propose appreciate it very much Mr Cole and the Committee Against will await your written consideration. Thank you Chad. Let's do arguments at that time and last one is the kept improving reserve fund and that is my. New proposal hundred a charter that allows us to use carryover see events without naming a specific project to be a potential reserve fund that the charter allows us to do. So this is cash. A special fund cash in the amount of one point one two five million dollars Mr White Yeah I support that but. I guess I'll wait till after we discuss this but I have another item I doubt I'd like to add here as well. That's fine I mean I'm open to that Mr Cochran thank you so this is. This would be a brand new reserve fund that the council would be. Setting up as David named us fourteen zero the charter that allows us to set up these funds and again I'm just trying to prepare the county in advance of what I know is going to come down is a very large bill regarding sewer replacement and I cannot. Give you any encouragement that you can depend on the federal government with eighty percent I'm going on the current understand how Congress is looking at more reductions of future budgets that we're going to have to pay this ourselves and if you look at the public or what Congress passed. Regarding maintenance every placement it is to be paid for by the users that's all a lie structured. So that is one of the reasons that I am asking you to consider this in that we are going to have to fund it only through. My. Directly related to my committee I appreciate this so but that heading can change because this one scene waste water reclamation facilities but I guess in particular sewer lines sewer line replacement so. I mean and this is it will just be here will keep adding as we see fit to add into this particular So for me though in my mind and by the way I did notice that Mr Director give noses here this evening. But because a reclamation facility could mean upgrading of the actual you know facilities U.V. Channels or what have you but the sewer lines that run laterals or what have you through the under the road side and into subdivisions are built whatever seem to be kind of everybody I mean if it works fine it's all has to do with sewer and you know the process process but. So I just want to make sure the verbiage is you know you know and so this one point one million is to also help offset I think production of the seven million and the twelve point five million in another section in our in the budget yaf those are this is the just money after I made my proposal Mr Cochran into the sewer for fun component of the budget. OK this is our calculation after my adjustments and reductions of what could be considered for this new research fund OK sure I don't know I know it's what your plan is for this for dinner but I was wondering if he would be available open to having Mr you know because I have those questions that I had my office had run through everything with him so we can run through this that I'm can you do even we can get consensus on these ones so it's up. It's to call if we can get it done the longer I have to stay tonight you know I believe that a lot of these cuts that you have done he's fairly OK any objection to being misdiagnosed. The only culture and I have is Mr White want to do something to this fund as well so. And that's and that's the point but OK you know if there can be some clarification because if we can get some additional things clear before the break it's a much less long he stayed to the right after she got in there and sort of Mr you know if you would please come forward. We appreciate your. Patience with the committee and we thank you for. Being available to respond to some questions from the members. And I know you appreciate this opportunity chair for Mr to come down so. Mr Cochran if you know. For us to where you want us to look at and have mistaken as a reason that with the question Sure my pleasure chair. Item one six three six Sorry my pages are different from your pages some I can't call it by the page number. One six three six and these are the sets. OK. You have the lens fifty seven yes and so it was the four items in reference to pump stations and what have you so I know we got a consensus on the three of the thirty thousand reductions. We got consensus so I wanted to highlight the two big numbers which would be number two. Wastewater pump station three at the four hundred thousand dollar deduction and just Mr you know as you know we're referring to. Number six the one point seven mil so if you have any comments. On those items and my question to you I guess. Will these deductions hinder your your job in moving forward such as number two wastewater Pump Station Number three modifications so. It's so for the projects these are what we estimate and until we get the bids the contraction be. Exact. If the. And we don't have any left over from the five hundred thousand in the colony Why then would come back for a budget. For the ones funded by S. Or if the revolving fall. We would call. A budget amendment ask for a bigger loan for those that are cash. Then we'd either. Come in from from that. One point nine million dollars. Or some other fun but right now without getting the contraction in those numbers are estimates it's just a matter of with the reductions we come in for budget amendment. You're at your pleasure so having. Directors say that I'm comfortable with your reduction. So that's an it sounds like. A plan B. To you know if in fact he does need. Mystic you know as a director you know as you know we've. Had some discussion so for the. Most you know Council as me he's making that which is decreasing. For some of the requests. Do you go through a qualified bid list or do you put everything out for regular piece. For constructions are these are strict little bits so we develop the plans and specs put it out you know regular procurement and it's a strict So if you get that then let's say everybody comes high I don't see in the procurement lists Mr Bush Mr King when you know where by then you would say we don't have the money it's everybody's high so let's go to the qualified lists and you go she had a contract with a vendor and see if you can bring it within the budget for emitters is that something you. Are able to do or have done in the past my understanding is the Q.B. S. Is for. Engineer a consultant professional services and it cannot be used for construction services and so typically what we've done is. If it's coming high we come in for either budget amendment or we look at the scope of work to see what we could try to either cut for this particular fiscal year and maybe go through the next fiscal year. But we'd rather just have it as one job. So I don't think we can use the qualified so that is your understanding I guess Mr Wilkins to come back but is that part of the procurement law. That he can be used for construction or is that internal rules. Perceived use that how to administer this qualified business. Thank you Mr Chair it's my understanding it is part of its directly in one hundred three D. But it might be part of the administrative rules developed by the state. Procurement office I believe relating to procurement and I believe qualified bidding is limited to certain items only thank you. I swear director. Of. The country to do the. Bypass I think Mr. I think that maybe because there was a design so with that they can negotiate any differently from me because they don't develop the full specs the kind of everything is already designed in this plant can you do a design build. Projects that we have with that Cochrane brought up typically we don't do these because it's for four different types of project for this one for the we've we're completing the design so our practice is to design good design money wait a year. And then come in for contraction money so. These projects would not be conducive to a design build typically it's more for like road projects there are other things like that so we've never done it but it's something that we've contemplated on more complex projects like treatment plant problem so in your division you have most civils. We do have civil rights for construction management so we could assist in the design build then the engineers. That we have have done any. Wastewater design. We hired over concern for the configure management portion and so. I would think that it would be a limited skill set that we'd have our staff would have to do the design. Is something that. Team headed by Mr could do the design and you didn't follow through on the construction in the same build that way though they they don't do these one either they do more the construction management as well so we and this is following along from what. Philosophy was when it was a way for you know we've gone after the low hanging fruit which is what we feel is a C.M. Construction management and to kind of division or. The resources we have to do. We just felt that has been on of our scope and. Increase in the cult. Personnel. You showed me that you looked at the. Options that if you could do you would have considered it so I appreciate that effort the rector for the questions. So my. Proposal is to. Agree with your proposal even with my recycled water project going the next speech yes I mean. Hold on sixteen's are you know. And I wanted comment from director. Yeah the seven. Point seven. I believe he's OK but I just would like to hear in his words I suppose that there are. Some of your comments. The same as the other C A P projects that you know it really depends on what the bids come in and then we make the assessment of you know when to come in for what you know should the bids come in higher than his budget. So again yes. I do any other questions for the director. Because I want to. Yeah and so quickly page fifty nine seven hundred. Line seven hundred that's the whole force mean replacement Yes we had questions in reference to that and if there's a explanation I guess this is here in Central. Yes OK I wrote just a. Million Mr Director Yes I believe yes. Twenty percent so for each of the. Same situation where until we get the control. We have to come in for a budget amendment OK. So this is no different from any of the other ones OK. Thank you any other projects. And moving down the page at seventeen No sixteen. Again same comment yes the twenty percent it's something that you can live with for now and if need be more money then he'll come back to us so deletion is fine at this point the big. OK The babies are on page sixty at the top of the page. Seventeen. Seventeen seventeen. Million and. As far as I know Mr you know his and he can reconfirm here OK with the seven but really really really would like the twelve point five reinstated so. I can explain why we these things there are so getting back. Maybe closing statement and others see a twenty percent I mean if you look for the discussion but we looked at the last few years. And fifteen out of seventeen projects came in at or above. The project estimate and one of them was because we rerouted right away so we were still concerned about the reduction but you know whatever you want on the on that number to the. Treatment Plant modification stage one. We foresee that being a twenty five million dollars project but we broke it up over two years. Because of the. Twenty five million next year and so. This is really a placeholder and we will execute a contract between July two thousand and sixteen in July and December two thousand and sixteen. Years and years and so we wouldn't spend the money. The last half of next year and we would come in again for a. Fiscal seven for twelve and a half million dollar budget request OK hearing that from you Mr. Choose open to the twelve point five consideration so any other questions for the director. Takes care of all the questions for this department and just direct their members any other questions for Mr Again knows of or. I'd like to just thank you for his patience and thank you for being present to assist the committee this evening thank you thank you very much Mr Director Thank you Director OK So quickly members before we do take a break you know very few minutes we'll hungry Do we have consensus on all the projects that we were into it that the rector's as we heard his rationale and miss . Comment regarding she's OK We have consensus Cherry with your. Point five mil in case I was so I'm going to say tonight here we have consensus on Number Two waste water pump number three if consensus number five shirted waste water lives we already did that yes we have consensus on West smile we recycled water at one point three six yes sure what's a page number fifty eight so a consensus on sixteen fifty two sixteen. Thirty eight. Consensus. One seven zero two we already had those sorts of. Visits So yes yes that's the. Consensus one seven zero eight. Consensus and consensus twelve point five one seven one one seven one six to delete that note to. Keep the West Bank Yeah. Open to supporting. The story don't go in five four OK and censor incest H one S Kate thank you sorry you did this. One seven one too no I'm not sold on that one OK. Me neither Oh no no no no he said OK to do. Some more good so we have consensus Yeah great thank you oh yeah OK. Do it now don't do it sorry yes miss your shit more fifty nine numbers sixteen seventeen. Cents us on that. Page fifty eight line one six seven zero I have consensus I don't know I want to yes yes yes. Yes OK And and on. What you have it on sixteen fifty two well right sixteen fifty two I have consensus was my recycle expansion at one point three six yet that's consensus OK members thank you for your patience but we completed round two. Yes Miss waiting for you move on and like to make a recommendation on the last page number line number. Line number twenty three sixty eight. Six age eighty four. Yes I'd like to propose doing the same thing for water as you've done for waste water or capital improvement reserve fund or water facilities to keep the trees open to your. Me before you can have it written out for us after the recess Mr White which a separate to have that part of the considerations for the next. Thank you so members were going to take it to our break in one thirty. In the meantime please get some nourishment and rest but also prepare for the next round which is if you need assistance from staff Mr by Mr regarding your proposal your language for provisos language for naming projects. Will be available so as to are sufficient for you to have your I think you have requirements or you if you want it shorter I am I'm open to that because I'm awaiting your. Considerations members are going to short it. Just. Yet we still going to need to do rates to members. I mean I'm open to you folks members from you know I'm going to give you two hours but if you want line of clock we can do it I know five. Hour or half I mean we're not we're not going to work off of a new We're not asking the staff to redo the sheet are we know not of this thing. This time. It's meant looking after our break to come back and do that around three I would like to start start of because the schedule was that we would complete tonight but we are not going to complete it tonight but we will do as much as we can because we are coming back tomorrow and I know what's happening tomorrow it's a different many people on many fronts. So you get what nine o'clock. So members nine o'clock AM. I mean I mean I just say OK let me. Just because I want to make sure the staff gets to have their ability to take a break to NEVER might forget that the staff is very they're they're just wonderful they will accommodate the needs of the members so you tell me our half nine o'clock Yeah no I understand. But we turn at nine P.M. Recess till nine P.M. . Bring this meeting back into. Members three three. Everett in a written form so that all members can see that language that you would like to have considered the budget you are proposing cuts that. If you would like to add Re Store you need to come up with one. Source or your plan to pay for it in your proposal to be willing to recognize it questions Mr Courage Thank you Mr Chair before we get into that do you know when in the schedule you're going to discuss the language for the A.B.C. Accounts because I I think that warrants a huge discussion so I don't know what the end or we can do it now if that will help you make decisions but it won't make. It won't change my mind at all but for me that it's cruel to making zero based budgeting work part of how you. Part of the basic premise of. You know the. Measure and scrutinize within the categories like he said it served America well the last few years and this is what he's continued to move forward to make adjustments in his county. This dog. And other tool from my mare CALDWELL So again. Performance. Of the last few years has made this chair really strong. Sticking to. Your house again will perform and part of that is my. Unhappiness with operational. Income and tell us you don't have enough money to finish the year for. You. A few times that. So again within the parameters of your full. Revisits. We've got to come to some conclusion and decisions the schedule has to be able to conclude this we are not going to make internal diddling So we're going to do as much as we can we will work tomorrow and if need be. It depends where we are. It can wrap this up fast or we are tracked it but I definitely have a deadline because staff needs to be able to do the final adjustments and be ready for us to submit for. As well as clerks requirements for publication requirements did lanes within the general ten. Ten a charter. So we work backwards. From the deadly and I will always make sure that we have sufficiently ability to unforseen things happen that we're not pressed against the wall and and boxed in a corner I have learned. When you have all given comment you don't want to be in a corner so the scale is built with flexibility not a lot but we've got to come to terms members and you know we all have and that's why we're here we have nine different points of view we have to sit. With that Mr Chair if you if I have the floor Mr Cossey Yeah if you. Are. Basing your decisions at least and maybe some of the members are whether or not we have a B. And C. I want to make a motion to remove all the chairs recommendation and checks Section seven that's the where are we. Going to I'm not sure he's talking about general provisions in the general position vision to Section seven with the yellow That was the chair suggestion that we have discussed this before. We move forward. Yet Thank you. Members do you need to find it. Yes. I'm not sure time going to make any difference yeah. We're going to take a recess subject to the call of the church to let you for a new document. Here Mr Thank you Mr Chair and. You know normally when we do things like that something as big as this we usually sit and have a discussion in committee. And this. I'm open to listening to this in a time when in the committee which is this prior to doing the budget so we all know what's going on. Because I'm a little confused as to what will happen if we go one way or the other so I would love the least have Mr Baez kind explain the way it works now and and what the consequences would be of passing this what are some thoughts with us. If you prefer you know I mean you know required to because. The only members I understand and I appreciate the opportunity to chair. The way that the county has been operating for at least the last two decades has been a fiscal control on the program level our ifas accounting system sets up a set of controls and it's built on the idea that each one of the programs listed in the ordinance is a separate control so that's how fiscal controls are set right now. The language that is proposed in chairs Section seven amendment suggests that the fiscal controls be not only by that program level but also by the character level which is the great salaries wages premium paid as IT operations which is materials and supplies and surplus kind of items are the B. And C. Account which is capital expenditures and leases things that are capitalized are in. Right now our system would not be able to maintain that control automatically there's nothing that we can put in the system right now as is that could allow for the system to have those controls at the. It can be redeveloped it would take time and money to do that but it's something that can be achievable. So as far as a technical aspect of it that's kind of where we're looking at and if we were given some time and maybe the. Upgrade request in the bargain to finance. And that be the direction of this council for future budgets you know we could develop it into that it would also on the secondary side not just the technical side but the actual operations and budgeting of the departments give them an opportunity to develop budgets that meet the desire of the council to have it restricted in those certain aspects. Because you know we've been operating twenty years or so under this structure of programs and you know the transfer money. Between characters or not be so concerned about how much you're spending in each character level. You know. The budgeting has been been. Compromised But you know those aspects aren't always followed very closely. So that's just an operational aspects so you know because of that if if those these fiscal constraints are put on the budget for this year I imagine that we'd be. About halfway through the year or so probably sending up quite a bit of resolutions to the council to. Move those monies between character levels between the B.C. Accounts once we start to develop actual expenditures. I have already produced reports and sent them out to the departments so that they have a better understanding of what they are fourteen expenditures were how those were actual expenditures as compared to budgets so they can see where there are some maybe differences in how they're budgeting versus how the actual expenditures are and so that they can maybe start to develop. A better understanding of the difference in that type of budgeting versus what we currently do so I haven't gotten any responses back from them you know I've been sitting down here on the floor but we did send that out to the departments as well. I've gotten some anecdotal feedback from the departments that it would be a challenge others said No problem you know it's really up to this council and and how we see fit I from a technical side say you know if we can wait a little bit you know and maybe make the policy directive and we set this for fiscal year seventeen budget. I think that it's something that's implementable I think the opportunity for the chair I think you missed it was so so we're under discussion OK Thank you Mr Chair and I you know I don't have an issue with it so much as long as we have a chance to discuss it at a full committee meeting. I think in the middle of all of the stuff that we're dealing with now that to to have this happen without a. You know a good in-depth discussion with the departments on how it would work you know you heard some could it could work it worked before a long time ago my other biggest concern is that it's going to this committee is going to be going to have to be a full day committee you know once or twice or four times a month because there's just going to be a lot a lot of stuff come through. And I'm fine with that too it's just I'm I'd like to be the guy who cuts the red tape as much as possible and I think we're adding a lot of red tape on this in my personal opinion so that's the reason why I made the motion Thank you know thank you very much. Let me just share some thoughts with the members. From day one when. You folks ski me the privilege of chairing this committee I made no secret about we had tended to take this budget to. Zero based budgeting in A.B.C. Accounts it was no secret I made it no secret in fact I felt that I was so public that managing director Reagan was with so foresight already then looked up zero based budgeting out what do you follow and share that information which is the apartment's knowing that this where this committee chair was moving toward. Because they even got a copy of what he shared with his departments he was kind enough to share what he phone regarding zero. Budgeting with myself. I would say members. For your chair I understand the rich keep coming from Mr coach however from the community I think they really appreciate and want to be able to hold but departments accountable. For spending and whether or not but to tell this council through this committee of how do you intend to use the people's money do they really feel feel. But see that is part of accountability. I am chained to make it easier for the public to view in our review. To be able to understand and follow program based budgeting. For those departments to do it well like I said I thought the police chief did an outstanding job it was quite easy to follow for other departments I don't like smoking screens and hiding and then funds to make what they want to get accomplish that and not necessary what the council has bought the rights to get a look at your own budget acquisition sheets that was after council Review Council denial and still purchase and acquired direct opposition of the council's decision. Debility of the people that want to know how does this things happen after trying the night and it still gets. This part of our responsibilities. And being accountable of the people's dollars you know I have would have no problem going to a survey and Essien the tax base at this point in time do you trust your money with administration or the council I have no doubt but the answer is going to be it's the council we have shown to be responsible in holding the feet to the fire and those that expend public monies accountable for their actions and decisions as part of governance that's part of what the charter requires this legislative branch to be responsible for I would say part of this proposal. And I think Mr cultural Bridgette for into the motion. Is the result of twenty years of this type of budgeting and lack of holding feet to the fire and making people responsible for doing things against Council decision and the consequence of policy. Look at the growth of the budget look at the growth of the carry over savings This is after what we thought was a frugal and responsible budgeting. People watching right now so we want to be responsible accountable for it we willing to continue the status quo and not be able to tell them what goes on and happens with their money regarding A.B.C. I understand the technical issues brought up by Mr Boss but then we let our ifas reports how does it get into each subject area code A.B.C. a County right there in the reporting it is being done currently and others are concerned about the operations to should there be any issues with c.a.p wonder operations life is already breaking it down and that's what we refer to and who into the departments went through the ifas lists when to subject codes that is coming it's being done. Flexibility and the privilege of. Going to back to where we are is something that to me the department's need to. Fight allies and put the story the confidence and trust in this council to give them that privilege of being able to budget and expand in that manner but in twenty years I have learned that this is we've come to a point where I can tell you I believe this. Consideration is now where it's needed and the time is now to recommit to corrections. Issues from the audit. Adjustment in direction on fiscal policy and fiscal discipline. And I think we'll be OK and let's see how they perform and again they restore the confidence in the body we can start looking at loosening up again but I think we need to bring order back and discipline back in our departments I think we need to really think hard on when they ask us for the people's money where they can be done or not and we will budget accordingly if they made those hard. Decisions in their proposal that the be for us in this should be able to leave within the A.B.C. Accounts if they didn't then definitely they don't want the A.B.C. Accounts which tells me they didn't perform them in the preparation of this budget requests so that's where your chair is on why I am asking you to support bringing discipline back and accountability back so the council can be able to measure and make very informed decisions on how we want to make the next adjustments in the next budget step one. But I think the people deserve this review the people deserve discussion that mystic which initiate it and I know they're listening and watching us. But I think and I have faith in you that you take your accountability responsibility seriously . That this is your choice proposal on how to help implement that to this budget document for the discussion by other members Mr White. Thank you chair and. Not surprisingly I agree wholeheartedly with your comments. And the reason I do is this is not household budget we're dealing with millions and millions and millions of dollars here. And I think it's our responsibility under the charter to control the purse strings and I think it's critical for us to look at doing this because as you say so well stated the budget was prepared under the A and B. And C. Accounts that's the way they put it together all we're doing is adjusting their numbers. But I'd also like to point out that. Prior to our gaining access to ifas which is the accounting system. We had no idea what was actually being spent and so that provided us a window into what. What was actually happening in the actual and the operations and like you we now know the reports are exactly categorized in a B. And C. Accounts so this is not any mystery and while I understand that. Mr Baez's comment that there's no automatic controls I'm happy to provide the manual controls through playing out the ifas reports from time to time and making sure that they're following the guidelines that we provided ifas is set up so that it shows us exactly what we budgeted and exactly what was in cumbered in prior years what the expenses are to date what the expenses were for the current month and what the balance remaining there is no mystery. Everything we need to ask the departments to follow along with the ifas follow along with the stain in the A B. And C. Accounts is already in the ifas reports there's no nothing more that the administration has to do as far as I'm concerned because when their invoices are processed now they're entered in using and in the next code in a subject code after we make this adjustment guess what those invoices are going to be entered exactly the same way I don't need any changes to the system to be able to track the A.B. And C. Accounts it's already there and you know I understand that it can be a little uncomfortable for the departments if and only if they weren't they didn't spend enough time making sure that they. Figured out exactly what they needed in each area because. They've been maybe a little bit lax in some departments because of twenty years of being able to move stuff if they needed to. So I think this is a very critical move for us to make because it's going to make sure that when we're budgeting for budgeting with forethought and focus not winging it I'm not suggesting that all departments are when I think a lot of them put a lot of heart and soul and work end of this but their job is to create the budget and follow it our job is to make sure they do. Already provides us with that tool to follow the A.B. And C. Accounts so I think this is a very valid move I think it's a necessary move at this point because twenty years of having program budgets has led us to the point we're at now we have some departments that do an excellent job of following the accounts and we have other departments that have been getting a little bit lax and. And I don't think I need to say which ones because it's pretty clear and this committee. Do I feel we need to get into a long discussion in committee No because we've been working with this report since last year I think and it's been very good because the staff has printed out the ifas reports for all the members. To see and I think we're all very familiar with what's in the reports and how useful they are and how. How much detail is provided there that makes it unnecessary for us to have automatic trips or automatic controls. And to the point of it's going to create budget amendments and so forth. Maybe for this year but I think once everyone gets used to it it's it's going to work out just fine and I'm more than happy to put in the time extra time to make sure that we make adjustments as necessary if somebody has not budgeted as well as a could have but I think you're going to find probably seventy five to eighty percent of the department's budgets already just fine and they're a B. And C. Account so I don't think we're going to have. A big surge of amendments I support this I think it is a core responsibility of the council to do exactly this type of thing. Our job is not to make everything better of Rosa's for the administration our job is to give them the money and then verify. As establish expectations give them the money and with which to for form them hold them to it I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think most of us have spouses that expect at least that from us so thank you thank you for the discussion. To me. When this is come up before torch before. All of the arguments. Members. Of trouble because last time we had extensive discussion and I'm not going to. What it was. Before and it's a concern to me. We would pass out from Plymouth just to know it was all according to committee because it is something that has really a great impact when we were here before one cultural member middle statement. It was kind of funny at the time but I'll repeat it anyway. He was frustrated he didn't like frustrated he said you know. The bureaucrats just don't Smiley doing this and his point was that it wasn't it was something that he felt was actually being detrimental to the system and of course all of the comments you. Were given at that point to what was Munir both know were still Phone want you know. Whether it is now or not is another matter for discussion but it really should go to committee and I would hope that the person does go to committee and we can spend the time necessary on the thank you this is in committee and this is your chance proposal by so. Yes thank you chair and I did second the motion and I seconded because I think it's an idea that is worth definitely discussing because it is a huge. Difference with doing things and we've heard that at least twenty years we have been doing this this where there's kind of interesting to me that all of a sudden it's become a we've got a lot of changes right now and at the eleventh hour where we are already under severe time constraints and we really have not had time as a group to sit down and talk about things without having that clock hanging over us and that makes me uncomfortable. I understand. The need to have control. And I am concerned about passing something so serious. Because we I think we all know that it's going to be a change and some people may have budgeted correctly and maybe some people didn't and like you said yes you've been talking about this during the budget process but you know maybe the time to talk about it would have been September when the mayor started talking about creating his budget so I thought it was worth having this discussion and I'm glad we're having this discussion because this is you know we've got to talk and we as a group need to make a decision about where we want to go I personally would like to see us not do this tonight and spend a little bit more time with the ability to discuss it with the department we should have as we brought them in asked them how do you feel if we you know go with this and what effect do you think it will have on you I don't recall us having that discussion so thank you very much there for the opportunity to say a few words thank you for the thoughts of the members new discussion. Mr coach for a second and for I know you know thank you. Thank you sure and thank you I was wondering along with this piece of paper was about and I had read and didn't quite understand at first but now I get it. And thank you very much for the explanation is in your comments director BOCES opportunity to share also. And I understand what you and Mr Wade are saying and I'm my initial gut reaction is I'm on board and I support it but also I. Am reading through it it's a tall order and I think it does give. A lot of internal controls to us it's going to enlighten us a lot more in heavy heavy detail exactly what's happening and as you say that's that's our. Responsibility so I'm all for if extra work needs to be done in the opening you know rollout of such a program so be it but I think it'll work its way through and but there's a lot of details in here that I am not completely clear on see we discuss this we funds towards it we talk about it compensations and transfers and temper you saying Manson the list goes on and on so. It's. A micro managing but it's basically the definitely details of the ins and outs of every department and how they operate which again like you said we ought to know and I totally agree with them so. And yes you've been seen as your budget all along I just didn't know quite what it meant deep down. But I understand you know the philosophy behind it I guess in a sense are the intent behind it and. So to see how it goes but I I don't want any hardship in. Receiving the information that we need to to get this going as Mr Abbas explained in regards to our ifas a similar have you but as you say that stuff can be worked out and it can be worked through so I'm here to just sort of take it in and kind of let it settle in and soak in and figure out but I think the intent and the general overall philosophy of this I remain very much support you thank you thank you this cruel. Thank you chair you know I'm so tired I'm looking at this and. What's so different . Are you know I'm going to this incident are there some major major changes. You know it's got the B.C. Accounts I I I believe this is more or less so that when we come a next time. We have a better understanding as to how money and been re allocated yet as well as. Having counsel. Having full knowledge of what's what's going on so I I think this is. I think it's good you know so if it if. It's not kind of far off. Because I am tired I. Understand why I do support this and I you know it's kind of woke me up so I could. SHARE I support what you're trying but you're attempting to do to make the budget process I guess. Accountable with ownership I would like to look at it that way thank you you know the discussion members. Let the those who haven't spoken yet you're an opportunity if they show desire if not any further discussion. They're going to if you force want to and if not there's others that are second and final chance of anyone who wants to you know if you want disagreement thank you thank you. Take care of my kids they were home alone until my my wife got off for a clinic they I just walked in to I debate I suppose yeah I feel that there should be more accountability. I'm not sure whether this is the right approach or not. Considering this is my first time to hear this type of debate. Right now I would feel that. I would rather make a decision after we go through the third reading of things to at least get a better handle on the situation but. If if this process is going to make it more efficient where we don't have to spend long hours Hearst. In the chambers then I would agree but if it's something that's going to bog us down and we would have to hire additional expertise or professionals or increase our. Employees staff to to be able to handle something like this it might be another consideration that we need to look at. That would probably not. Be necessary at this point to increase our staff in this budget so the if we were to pass something like this we would be well equipped and prepared so there are other factors to be considered. I don't know which. Method or model is better than the other I know that the one that I've been working with for the last three budgets is quite difficult to get through. So I'm open for improvement but I would also like a thorough analysis of what is the difference between the two so that's where I stand if you you think. You know I have been here all day sorry and no apologies you were serving the council and yeah I just leave and so it's really hard because I don't know what all the discussion was going on today but going back over the last few weeks and what you've been saying and understanding that you know. Progressive management of budgeting is important and that we we start to look for changes we've grown as a county that's first and foremost let's be honest we're not a small little county as twenty five years ago when our population has grown our budget has grown I think we're the second largest budget in the state behind City County. We're not the largest with the third largest population second largest land mass I mean you know you can go on and on and on different different things but we have grown tremendously we're very progressive colony on a little today I'll give you an example three things was coming across to me every time I meet with somebody number one first thing you guys have money that's the first thing they always tell me to my face almost every legislature I met that's one of the first reactions you guys have money and I said Well that may be true but that's because of fiscal I'll put in fiscal policies we've had through the US that's a fact we've been fortunate we've been very fortunate our forefathers and you know what I'm referring to your dad and those would be really had good foresight to put us where we are today so those who complain about how bad we is I mean they go some other county and you find out a lot worse goes on there the second thing that came across today was you folks have always been an independent leader you decide what you think your county needs and you take care of it. And I said Yeah we try our best we like to work with everybody else we like to play with the team but when the team is not going in the right direction we can't continue going down that that that road at thirteen and then I want to stop because I know everybody's died and I miss crew paralyse and it's getting me just like anything but the third thing I think was very important was the fact that we show up there and we bring justice Dix and data not in UN Those or opinions we've got a lot of data Thank you Mr White in Troy and my staff for putting all this together because whenever they had a question here read the facts the facts are right here what it was would say and what it was for Mr Sukie whether she'll be look I don't care who it was I just and I took forty copies down and I gave all my forty copies. And the facts were there so that's wonder why the reason the roads in them but when I said we had two hundred twenty I said every county has as much if not more than we do you know this is going to be three three and a half three three hundred fifty to five hundred million or more in expenditures and you want to get in every million a year at a quarter percent or twenty two at half a percent you've got to be kidding me no it took it up I don't see what we're going to do with the rest of this it took it up and that was a big key and finding ways to cheer you know as the president of the one of the largest organizations in this country the counties of my Rani's of of this country who are the ones that have probably the most dealings with the people who day in and day out like you've said many times we're where the rubber meets the road we the people's represent the shit we've done a lot of great things all I'm seeing is for me change is going to come. But I agree with all my colleagues I want to make sure the change is done right I want to make sure everybody has some input that's what we all talk about right. For example fire I'll give you a quick example right you guys all came running say we. Went back. When it comes but I went back to the people who were affected and asked them maybe this time we sit down and asked them. What we can do to work with them and they can work with us they've got to start learning the facts that is what you can live with and what you can live with and then we can move on if you look up to me and then you know what not going to work if you're going to give me a song and dance with some directors try to do and going to work and then we start you. Then we go. And we give you what you think and you figure it out from. What I read of them come in and say hey I want to work with you how can we all work together that's enough I should when I should have thank you very much Mr you. For the discussion. Which. Chair and I really enjoy the discussion in the back and forth because you get to hear all the different perspectives and you know we discussed that at the break. Just our philosophies or what you might say. You know there were comments made you know where are we now we're here with a budget that gets awards every year we get people from. Saying you guys got money. That's where we are with these budgets we are every every member here said you know with the good fiscal responsibility we've been able to keep this county afloat this is the good fiscal responsibility. You know we have audits if we want to countability we have audits we have the ability to audit here we now have an auditor that we can't direct but we can certainly suggest so there's plenty of options for accountability. You know. Just because Mr Goodman came in a little bit late. We're doing this now at the beginning because this could make people's minds up as to how they want to do their provisos and they're there changes in the in the in the budget as we're going through and past three so we kind of have to do this now so as Mr Holcombe a said it's it's better to do it up front. Mr okama you say we do policy we buy certain things by. Taxation by zoning code by telling you know setting policy with our laws and whatnot there's a difference between setting policy and as. Mr Cochran said micromanaging and you know. Ever since I've been videotaping these meetings here on this floor that word is being bandied about since one thousand nine hundred ninety three is when I think I started doing this so it's not a new term. I guess when people are sitting here they get accused by up there by being micromanaging people up there are Jews it just goes back and forth I think this is the the definition of micromanaging we're here to set policy by saying you know what department of finance you get this amount of money we expect you to we would like you to spend it this way this way and this way but things happen you. You got to buy five vehicles and you save money so you only only pay the amount for four so you got money for another vehicle but you can either buy another vehicle or something happened with a professional service or the price of gas went up you can move that savings into the operations account now that's the way it is now if that same thing happened with the way. The new proposal is then in order to take that money that you saved in equipment you have to come to council who is already busy doing a lot of stuff and this council in the last two terms has been extremely busy. I remember again when watching the video tape it wasn't as intense and as busy as these councils are and I really appreciate how how hard everybody is willing to put their. Mind and soul into this. This job so we've got a lot of work we're doing and we're trying to counsel county in a direction to have to stop and say OK you can move your gas money over to our I mean your vehicle money over to gas you know all the work downstairs trying to cut people down stairs they're going to have to go through all of that process to I mean it's just like you said red tape anyway. And yes Mr White you are correct this is not your household budget. This is a huge responsibility but I think it's our definition of policy is. Big big kids now. We're adults we say this is what we would like this department to spend spend it if they keep doing tricky things to our dislike then maybe we can we can. Hammer them individually on that but again we don't want to micromanage so and this to me is kind of a definition of micro-managing THANK YOU THANK YOU anyone else for discussion Mr White thank you. As you stated. This is been something you've been telegraphing and and stating for weeks. Since one thousand nine hundred eighty eight has been changed so you know and we I can remember who I discussed it with but it sometime earlier this week we anticipate in the department heads will be coming down here complaining about a B. And C. Accounts I don't remember hearing from more than maybe two. Maybe people have been here and other side sidebar discussions regarding it but I don't you know I've not gotten any real pushback I'm not sure that they would come in and ask me for support on. A B. And C. Accounts but you know let's let's be clear this is not something that is a big deal in my view it's maybe it's a little it's something I'm more comfortable with than others because I deal with numbers all the time this is not a big deal and if if I'm an department head well if you work for me and you come to me with a budget. Then you're telling me that this is what you need for salaries this is what you need for operations and this is what you need for equipment and I'm going to hold you to that that's all we're doing here. And the only people who are going to be uncomfortable with this are those who have fudged their budgets and you know we you know we've been made aware of departments convincing the council that they need an extra an extra big truck they don't buy it because they want to use it for something else well you know it's our job to start putting the lid on that kind of thing. The challenge with the. Call lazy budgeting having a program budget is that this budget process is more of a mess it's more complex because it's difficult to compare one with the other and as you said you know we sit here for weeks trying to make sense of what the budget is trying to accomplish and where all the dollars are and as I said before part of this process for us is we're on an Easter egg hunt because we know they've hidden money for our job as a Find out where simply putting this in place is going to make the Easter egg hunt last a little less long and I think it's something that the city and county of Honolulu has been doing for a long time they've got a much bigger budget than we do they've got much more complexity in their operations and we do but they manage it without a problem. And I also like to say that if you know I've been going through this with a little bit more relaxation in my cut mode knowing that we're looking at putting that into a B. And C. Accounts we're not going to move in the in the direction of A B. And C. Accounts being sequestered then I'm going to want to go back and revisit some of the. Some of the lines because I mean I want to cut more I'm you know I'm comfortable leaving some of the numbers a little fatter if we're going to be keeping a expenses in the air count and B. And C. So. You know I don't I don't see this as micromanaging I see this is doing our job I'm not asking them I'm not telling them what their budget is they're telling me what their budget is all I'm doing is saying if that's what you say your budget is and stick to it and. The other thing that I would like to mention is that. If this is such a big deal we have until first reading even have until the second reading if somebody wants to convince us that we should take it out I think it's something that's appropriate to do I think it's something that's necessary to do just as I feel it was necessary for us to start looking at the ifas reports and if you if you will all remember back to what we were able to accomplish last year because we had access to the accounting system it was significant and it wasn't by micromanaging it was by simply saying if you didn't spend the money why should we give it to you again if we need it somewhere else I don't want to give these big fat budgets which require us to go to the taxpayer and ask for more money only for their money to end up as carry over savings and so I I feel this is a responsible thing I think it's something as a taxpayer I would demand and. So I think it's an important move for us I think it's a timely move after twenty years of lazy budgeting and I think we have a responsibility to the taxpayers not to asking for more money if we can simply hold people's feet to the fire and ask them to operate within the budgets that they gave us and if there is a problem more than happy to reconsider go through a budget amendment and provide them the resources necessary to do the job thank you thank you. Thank you chair and. I'm glad everyone had long explanations I could kind of through this inserted digest it a little more and. Look through. More clarity on it or not at this hour. But you know it's saying that there's changes. Give us reasons explain them which difficult it's just the five and just say why. We received notices of reallocations or reclassification as we've been talking about here it just takes forever and a day to do that so it's not like is going to happen all the time. Receive notice of any temporary this or that. If it's expected to be more than thirty days or so and it's just it's again an accountability tool here is what I'm gathering. And the appropriations may be dispersed by department to reimburse another department that's understandable you know public works helps with a lot of departments and they get that reimbursement for the services they're provided for their fellow County Department. So I'm like you know what I'm seeing and I understand the program we have ifas is exactly what we go through and I think that is why we have to sit here and ask a bazillion questions to get down to the nitty gritty of what is being said and why because it's not clear and it's sort of tossed this time of the year or like OK what is what but if we're kept up to speed all throughout by the time this part of the year comes around for budgeting weary or kind there is no I'm figuring if thinking straight and you know I'm just figurine I remember I think what kind of trigger one of the triggers could be when a department state it up some money is used for c.a.p and how does that happen. You know positions being we created we gave funding for some positions and then we end up the next year they were used for some else they read described or whatever into another thing and that was not what we intended. You know I have put in improvises or proviso do specific dollar amounts for specific tasks of the department to be used that way to. To help to reinforce what they asked for number one and number two to make sure it's done and then it never got done so what does that say. So yeah I'm really understanding what you're trying to accomplish here and I have to say with a vote in favor of it thank you. Q. Yes. You and I discussed this. I agree I understand the idea of because you know control and people are doing better but one of the concerned is the budget amendment process that we use no it's not efficient takes a long long time I don't know how many amendments we have sitting around here right now but I imagine there's quite a few My concern is that I think we did something like three dozen amendments this year now if that is an indication without the restriction on the seas What are we likely to be looking at in the upcoming year and if we're going to do this as we as we've discussed I'd like to come up with us to come up along with the restriction would a better process due process budget amendment and I don't have that in front of me so we're kind of doing a half and we don't have the other half but that's where I'm at I just don't want to hamstring people in getting things done. High up your committee and doing nothing but amendments which could be the case. Thank you for your concern and your comment. That the secure. Individual members have talked about. Discussions. If that doesn't sure to just news tool to community I don't know what will. The one thing that we always want to. Know. That I hope to commit to thank you thank you Mr Carroll anyone else would like to give their second and final comment on the motion of the chair we just say that they me read the proposal so the community can try and follow as best as possible this is the proposal from the chair under Section seven I'm not going to read the whole thing because I was going to read the part that is important unless otherwise provided here in appropriations for each program Mady may be dispersed. And this is where the amendment starts within the office department or agency for which the appropriation is made for the following categories of use A Yes they count salaries premium pay or allocation pay be the be account operations or services and see the C.E.O. Account equipment provided that the appropriation is within that category or use for which it was appropriated and further provided that any transfer from one category of use to another shall be authorized by council resolution in any transfer from one department to another shall be authorized by ordinance that is what the church is proposing in his A.B.C. Account. Proposal just let me share of a couple of things because they all gave very good points we all know that the church can set up. For which I am looking at would be the fiscal year didn't twenty sixteen. Amendments to the budget is it all or directly for us can be made then without going through a council posting here we see straight into a committee that would be expedited by reducing two weeks of the going through the traditional council. And then the church can then work with Mr Buzz and see if then. You've had Vance notices to departments that if they wish to have a amendment to for consideration did they meet internal deadlines that Mr Buzz would set and then san but they're pretty tame. All considerations within that timeframe so if it's only one it's one if it's a bunch it'll be a bunch but we can then review and dispose of. Quickly second one of the things that taxpayers residence the general public is demanding more of all three levels of government structure federal state and local government this county is the issue of transparency. Part of the confusion why we take along is that we're trying to figure out how did certain things when we put monies in different areas that is what the church has learned through this budget review that we have a lot of questions on what happened in every district can point to a example Mr Carroll can point this law on a landfill let them do it that was author A Yes he did not get in the attendance. It was taking away the what we authorized and transcribed to a different job in a different district. The belay being that there was a transparency and what happened. We only find out after it's done. But that's not what we approved and supported Mr Charles district with so if we're asked by the public what happened with the transparency and we never know that what is happening you never authorities that how do we answer where is transparency for the public to judge us in our work part of this is transparency letting the public actually what the departments are doing with their money their own money. You know we are asking that nonprofits to be accountable should hold the same standards for the departments. Were asking for transparency to understand how things are being done so that we can make the better informed decision as we know what is happening within the accounts. For me yeah Mr Carro is right and to my disappointment I wish my peers at that time in those terms supported my position of locking it up because I believe if we did it then. Where we are today tonight would be a better position and maybe we would have the confidence to grant a little bit more flexibility as they have performed improve that we can trust them we have the confidence to appropriate in that man again I'm not there anymore because I believe transparency has eluded us smoking screens within categories and shift you know funds that we do not approve of so I believe this is a that will help us get accountability but assist us in proving to the public the transparency of how their county government works and this is not micromanaging this is accountability that is our responsibility by the people through its charter . So that's all I'm going to see let you folks make your choice and we are going to take a vote. To turn if Mr White just. I think it's always important when the night is late to make sure that it's clear what the vote Yes what a yes vote means and what a no vote means think you don't have any Thank you so if you vote yes on the motion you're asking to meet Dean the status quo. Program but budgeting a lump sum. And having to be parliaments do is they have been doing for the last years twenty years if you vote. That means you support the chairs proposal to create the A.B.C. Accounts and the reason said you heard why the chair feels it is important at this time. So you vote yes status quo no means A.B.C. . Are we clear any questions for the chair. All in favor of the motion that. Mr Coach which is to retain the current practice of no A.B.C. Accounts please see I I. I see one two three no no. Kate Mr Carroll. Misplaced I miss Cochran Mr Coach I. Just feel what it. Is to. Mr. Chair votes no the motion is defeated three six knows we are going to implement A.B.C. Account thank you very much it was a healthy discussion and thank you chair I don't think you missed the coach I appreciate you bringing up so that we have this discussion at this time. Let us move on through operating budget once more. I used up all my energy chair. If I had a level I can say is there is sugar for some of you with caffeine for all of you. And third is your natural adrenaline. So I'm going to be very deliberate I know you know where I am and you know you folks are very tired but I asked that we try and work through this together because this will be a Committee proposal but your proposal at the end of the day. So under the Office of the county clerk. Number eighty eight. Chair Yes ma'am that was that was the expansion position requests. I couldn't find anybody else OFFICE OF OPERATIONS ASSISTANT TO twenty eight seventy two. Chair as much as I I I would like to see in preparation for the upcoming changes in the next election. I couldn't dab into anywhere to. Match up that tells. Me that that. And members please again yeah please view that while we include it in this year's budget it doesn't mean that you cannot find the upcoming time in proposal that you cannot bring this back in the next budget consideration. This is. One year of many years of continuing funding for an operation so do not think that this is the final and sort of fall for this is the answer for this year's budget requests only. They will be another budget in ten months before us. So under lane eighty eight. Do I have any proposal on reinstating this and how to fund it Mr Cote Mr Chair on your how to fund it I mean the last few times we've done the budget where the every time I've done the budget here we've gone through found the number and then said OK now how do we get it. That's been the way the only way I have no doubt about it now you of course have done many more budgets and I you know. I'm not quite sure what you mean by how to fund it because you need to you know I want to see when you know what would you recommend to find it you would see through General fine which means at this point in time we are going to have to adjust the rates to increase in use for cash because this would be a cash we don't you know there's operations is not through any borrowing understood cash so OK we want to reinstate Then you that my request to you to avoid funny and he's going to. I'm going to raise general fund to raiding creases to be able to pay for this thing. And that's fine. But not the exact number we don't know because until we know yeah OK and total decide and we're not going to for every item. I just know. I didn't think so but I just want to double check because you know I get members. We don't finish then my question to East do you believe that taxpayers can afford it seven hundred million dollars budget because that was what was going to going affect if we don't complete our job and come you know for a seven hundred million dollars budget as proposed by the administration that's opposite of the spec. Eighty eight OK Mr Chair then Mr coach should like to propose to bring it in and I understand your comment about a seven hundred million a year right we can't but I think there is a happy medium somewhere in there hopefully more toward your number but there's a happy medium so I would. Move to put this position reinstate this position. And my intent would be to get it out of general funds. Second. You can get consensus and we never possible if we can do it that way it would that you would prefer that and if we cannot come to terms in then we will pick the book but as much as possible I would like to give the committee the opportunity to try to reach consensus. First. You heard Mr coaches. To reinstate the expansion and he is looking at increasing general fund to pay for this position is there any consensus on this requests consensus. We have no consensus. So now do you want the motion. And you know. No objections if we don't have consensus we're just going to do the vote I'm not going to take a motion because. I mean you have to make a decision. Is there any objections to how the chair wants to proceed because again this is a working document we will make a recommendation to Council Council and make a final decision. So we have no consensus. That was in favor of. The general fund requirements. Say I. Will say no. Mr Carroll. Sort. Misplaced. Mr Cochran Mr coach. Yes Mr White Mr Goodman I. Know. This is passes with six eyes so we're going to add it on. To the clerk's office. Reduction of equipment I think. We both have it written down as both Mr Goodman and me so Mr Goodman if you have. You have anything to say about this or OK. Mr Chair again. You liked the dropdown and so far I think you're the only one that used the drop down since we've had this in deference to the folks in the back and some of the folks over here that have find a hard time reading that even though that's a big huge screen and eventually if we get into this whole. Video and and whatnot this is a good time to get some of this in for this equipment and I'd be even willing to. Since we're going A.B.C. Account is to decrease the decrease in. Operations and then move it to the equipment account so make operations. Twenty twenty two for and then equipment but the twenty six hundred back that makes sense. I mean you can propose that and see if the members will buy that was it requests or since we're already looking at you know what number we're trying to find at the end we already got consensus on the reduction of operations. So I prefer you not do it by Den will do it through to the general fund and. Just like to believe that we have enough in the audio system. That we left in to cover this if the if the body decides of the clerk's office that this is the direction I'd like to go so on I don't think this is a necessary. Keenness a necessary restore. Thank you for that any further discussion on. That. Other fine. Audio system so there's no need for us to restart might understand that. We don't even have to address it and they want it they can use it from the audio system but generally Mr White generally they will the clerk is responsible for this chamber chambers. We've given them a substantial amount to replace the audio system because we're having. I mean challenges with it. And they've advised me that the amount they put in is. Is not going to it's not all going to be needed and so I think that there's enough money within that. That appropriation that's already been approved. By consensus not approved and repro paraded but. You know they're not going to do something that the majority of us don't agree with but I think you know I think it I think there's enough money in the budget for us to decide what we want to end up doing in here and I don't think we should be voting on a screen over there or over there or where ever that we're all going to discuss and figure out what we really want to end up with. The main thing we know is we have the discussion in what the. Category or account that. We're going to look at is so we can hold ourselves to the same standards that we would ask the departments of exactly so if you hear Mr Wait he's saying that within operations even with the reduction under the I guess that would be professional services more than likely to get into audio it is sufficient funding that could also be considered for I don't know you know I'm sorry I was talking just about the . Twenty six hundred dollars for equipment Yeah that's it see a cult you know I just I don't have a know whether we have. Consensus on operations or not yet we we had a. Reduction of twenty if I thought I was OK so I was I was right thank you. Mr coach but we just passed a B. C. Account so they can swap the professional services for the audio system is in the B. Account so they can. Audio system is equipment it was I thought it was professional services Boy that's. What they did is professional services. You. Mr Chair. On page three dash I can. Under the. Audio system for concert chambers and a sixty five thousand dollars OK OK So I stand it is in the C. a Car I'm fine with that. So we should be OK concerned consensus Thank you. Out of the office of the county clerk. Office like county council. Well we are in Lane ninety eight ninety seven ninety seven. Ninety seven. Right now it was we hit the green. Lane ninety seven the cherries asking to restore the two hundred thousand for legislative audit requirements think most of us were OK without a camera who I have missed by some. Description you want it. And Mr Chair. Since we are doing A.B.C. Account now. I don't think we need as much for services so I don't support that Re Store. Thank you for. Any other comments. Recess OK I'm going to take a short recess subject to the caller's chair. Thank you for the short recess. One thing I would tell the committee at this time. One of the things within the office of the calm. Of the council. Is that we have yet to set. For the council that A.B.C. Accounts we just agree to that we are going to do A.B.C. Accounts we are going and that is part of our review in this route is going to decide what will go in that counts there is no counts for counsel yet. So this is part of so there's going to be about whether this is in B.O.C. Because it's in not at yet under the way that the council has proposed a committee we're now going to set it but it was the A.B.C. . So Mr White thank you chair and I'm assuming that you also mean that for our individual offices will be doing the same thing that is correct so we will determine which part of our office budget goes and baby and see that is correct you have jurisdiction in oversight as well as responsibility within your own office accounts as to manage as we have always tried to reinforce is that we. Mr been just realized. But we expect the same of ourselves and we expect of the department said is correct Thank you Mr coach the question I would have though just just like this last the kind of quick program where I thought it was in in the B. Account if we had it if it was and we passed it so we do have to we do have to concern ourselves with what it counted by the time we go out of that department so it's not that there are no A B. And C. Accounts we have to act as if there is an. Accountant's OK the appropriate accounts got to thank you that's why I want a quick clarified. Ninety seven so audit service is more than we would prefer So that would be part of a B account consider Rhaetian. Two hundred thousand dollars chair I support that amount because it's. You can spend a whole lot of money on one audit to give you an example the audit that we just went out for. The bids came back and ranging from. I will give the exact numbers give us a range the range was. More than one hundred fifty thousand dollars apart so that should tell you that if we do one audit we can exhaust this whole thing we do it's short So my feeling is that to pretty much limits our ability to do audits but I'm I'm comfortable with that thank you any other comments members are going this maybe we should put more in there because of the A.B.C. Accounts that you know. I would just say that that is part of what the charter. Places responsibility on this body is it is one of our fundamental to believe sponsibility a great shot up to this branch of government in this specific body. So if enough of you feel that we can increase it but the current proposal is two hundred thousand dollars I'd like to see consensus. Is. The only weird thing about this one is that since this is a council thing we can't make changes once we set this in unless the main unless the. Been done right and I would be half so we can't count on changes you cannot assume that right so we have to be very careful with that. So you know that's where we need to budget appropriately I would be open to Mr COUCH as mentioned to increase it to three I didn't I would support the. Request to increase at least one other thing Mr Goodman Sorry yes I would like to propose an increase to. Three three hundred thousand. General fun stuff. So I understand the members are at it Mr. Recommendation is to have its services at three hundred thousand and he is recommending that it be funded through a general fund. No no we don't so we show as Mr Carroll. To the three hundred thousand for services for the council. The want to thank you no thank you. I Mr coach is Covello you Mr White. Mr Goodman. Mr victory you know. Best as with six three. Hundred thousand Mr. Just a small clarification I believe the counsel me. Send up amendments to its own budget its permitted American amend his operating budget the council can amend its operating budget as we see within the same budgetary framework but we cannot ask we can the proposed increase right the council's budget as long as we stay within the current budget parameters that the resolution to shift within the. Council services budget is appropriate That's absolutely correct sir but you can amend I want to make that clear I think you make your kid so you further advice from from peroration counsel that internally within the current the proprietors of the appropriation of this budget you visions can be made. Through the council which is office for consideration of a resolution. OK let's see line ninety eight. One twenty seven zero five nine under salary and wages so this would be in. Consideration. We have any proposals. To restart. It is that what. Is appropriate and you would recommend spinning this through Gen But General Franks OK thank you for that you heard Mr Bellows. Members any other comments misplaced I supported and that's one of the reasons why I didn't want to increase the audit I was looking for money. I appreciate that it's a place. I know your philosophy from. So. I think you understand it so thank you for the discussion members census Do we have . I guess you know the whole thing about the changes you want find your money. I mean for the people for any money but to just generally say is coming from General fun for me I'm not comfortable read were enough to do it by raising taxes. Or something we're going to have to do it but I just seen the chairs. I mean we have to find the revenue somewhere that's correct and so I've managed to figure all my stuff out there for fifteen thousand dollars so much but thank you I have an idea and these are like big huge pots which I think fifteen thousand out of them wouldn't break it and so I'm just. I feel like I want to just say no on these because I don't find the money and I'm not comfortable trying to raise taxes so I you know what I don't want to look like some or whatever and no no no no. Every single thing around here but I just that is just how I've been reading this and doing my budget in my head a proposal you know the. That's why I wrote that's why I know I can. You know I don't find that many and for raising I just not supportive so they're just and I guess. The church thinks you are trying to find different ways of funding and I know you did. You were you in your staff to that you know a good job in trying to deal with the parameters and instructions so I thank you for trying to find it in other ways than just reliance on the general fund and increasing the. Property tax requirement so yeah I appreciate that and that for me was the easy way out and but I just didn't I couldn't figure out for myself so it was just so I can now here and I appreciate I'm going to go on your record that you know you try to approach it from a different perspective and then we thank you for that. Other other comments on this restoration requests. At just like to assure Ms Cochran we're not going to always be in agreement and that's fine and I agree that going to have to find a bunny's but how ever. I think I would have preferred if. The organized within the internal organization and if the cherry self. Would have said you know I don't need this position anymore. By then I could be more supportive care. If this is what we want Still I feel that the monies are there. There's a reason there's been this position for many years. For this reason I definitely would like to see it restored unless our constant year was otherwise Thank you for the comment. Mr White thank you chair in the as I said the other day the. The organization. Needs some fine tuning. But as MISCA Bellow said. I don't think it's appropriate to cut out all these positions at this point and if there is a problem then the the first the first responsibility lies with me and then secondly it will come back to the council if. If it's determined that we have a problem needs. Dealing with by terminations. So. I think it's appropriate for us to restore these positions and. And then we can have for the discussions on how to further deal with it. The the. I agree with the reallocation and assignment of some additional positions. But it's something that I think we we need to give a little bit. Of a bit more thought to. Thank you for your comments any other discussion Mr coach for recess sorry recess. Thank you for that short requoting Q Mr Chair Thank you Mr coach. Members The chair would ask objections. Because I think we're going to hear the same thing for ninety nine and one hundred . So the chair has no objections if you have and then that we take ninety eight ninety nine and one hundred and one review no objection. Because I think you're going to meet the same. Comments regarding your thoughts regarding the next two considerations also. And that the chair would just say thank you for reviewing this proposal and it's a. Very different approach to our own budget but I appreciate that you at lease took time to review it and. Are now ready to make a decision for this coming budget so from the church I just wanted to see Thank you . So no objections we are going to take ninety eight ninety nine and one hundred and one. Consideration you heard the comments from Mr White that any other additional comments. Is there consensus consensus at least move this forward. And I'm going to say we are going to all work. Rates leader. So that. That. Keep my running accurate please by funds. Recommending the deletion of salary adjustments forty thousand forty sixty eight that we have consensus we still wait. To hear from others. Mr Chair I can't remember I thought last year we we did not do increases as well. That's like that is not correct OK. Mr White Mr White the reason I'm just give them back on the reason we. Made a determination. At that point that period to place in the committee the discussion about increasing that so that we could discuss whether or not we look out continuing with the step increases or not look at merit increases or not. So. I'd like to leave this number in so that we can have that discussion as we promise of staff we would do so you want to so I think that this restoring it restoring it and we have. Staff is working on a proposal for your committee's consideration thank you very much for that. Comments Mr any other members have comment. Then I'll just put it this way. Support Mr weight with reservations. Because I don't really support salary adjustments right now for our order ranch but I will not stand in the way of moving things forward. So we have consensus. OK we show the story of this. I am going to work I have proposed deletion of the five part timers again I am told there is one thirty our part time out that I was not informed of. So again even transparency in our own branch with his fury is always easy we just disturbs me. So Mr White Any comments. Part timers I think would. One change that I think is one that we may want to consider as that we have. We do have a strong need for an additional legislative analyst so I would like the Committee to discuss whether we reduce the. Amount spent on the part timers by forty one thousand. Amount that we would need for an additional legislative analyst OK. That's one of four lane one for Mr. White is advocating for one for. As it impacts one or two. But this is one of few things Mr Wade and I would disagree I think the committee secretary is more critical especially after it seems you've seen the changes when I was away. Regarding what support the vision doesn't do any more that used to do so I think it's added costs to this branch unnecessary additional costs by the restructuring of the Support Division and again how. We just the only way it leaves invocation it were tame I'm not a happy camper but I think we can do a better job with the people's money within our own office. So you know again members if you want to support the claim considerations whether it be the secretary of the analysts or both I would say if you want to support that we need to reduce part time most maybe not all of it but some of it is like going to see just of. Put up tax piece why we need. Because if we're going to look at the same positions also this is a victory in their mind and what I would ask is that we reduce that. Consular services assistance that's what you thought going to. Forty two thousand five hundred. Give them the opportunity and any other comments on one or three and one of. Week to Reno you heard Mr White he prefers one of four yeah I would be one of four and definitely want to fork over one or three. You for you. If I could just point out we don't deal with B.P.'s So in the mayor's office don't . So it doesn't. You don't need to decide on whether it's an analyst or a secretary tonight because or we're not assigning a specific position to that so. I would suggest that we. Delete the I'm out of thirty three thousand to ninety six that would leave us with higher about that would cover either direction that we decide to go that decision doesn't that to be made I. Thank you for you thoughts on that Mr Coach you wish to chair. The question I would have. Sounds like Mr White is using is saying we want one or the other is that right is right not both positions . I think well that's up to you guys but my only concern is I don't know that we have any space down there or we're going to put him we definitely need him I think in both I think I know the secretary is very crowded. Very tight and I think there might be one. In one cubicle in the and all the analysts are saying no so. We also have to consider that in operations or. Equipment because we're going to need to. Understand the logistical issues that you bring up Mr coach. But logistical can be overcome the key is whether or not you want to. Staff at a level that makes sense for the councils overall responsibilities as well as you as chairman's of various standing committees and the ability for the company to do perform. And the level of quality of work you want to be perform to the community and it's a sign staff I think should be the key question first and then once you make that decision we can overcome with just sticks. You know a lot of considerations going on regarding the My how are property they have to structure. You know consideration Bank of Hawaii is choosing to abandonware look so that property is going to be available maybe to state you think about it also as potential acquisition. There's still one main plaza that we currently have so we can make certain shiftings again what you feel is appropriate staff level to conduct the business of a branch of the legislative branch of this county that for me is the more important that we answer. Because whatever it is if you want to ski team at the current level then you are. In everything you've got to understand that's you know where we are which they're free in their current workloads and. The time it takes to. Requests from members for services. Is by so thank you very much. I. Think we have too many stuff called my experience in working with them is that they are very busy of a lot of work to do the man's putting them in because we have the policies and. Benefits You know they have to and they're there we have a right to. It with they take their sick leave whatever it is whatever else that. There is an awful lot of work but there is a huge influx and it's funny it tends to good example. For five. Months and then it wouldn't be any for a while and everybody wants to. And can have it by next possibly And so you know there's a lot of work to be done and all of it is on deadline Meanwhile committees are staff that only have one committee to staff and many of them staff to and we have additional committee this year which is another burden and so I don't think we have too many people and. I don't want to give up any of them I think we ought to figure out. And we talked about this a year ago and we're still thinking about it what we're going to reorganize and you know who would be doing what but as we are structured I don't think we have too many people and I'm not about to give anybody up. Thank you. Mr I I. Well. I'm going to respect what Mr White is. Trying to organize for the council office and also have to respect where consummate. Comes from. But I'm just going to say I don't know what what everyone does and how many analysts we have to what committees are missing their analysts. I know that some analysts go on vacation when you've done some assignments in the summer vacations but. You know the seventh floor as an outsider and I watched their working habits it's always head down and you know. Constant. To the ground and. I have a hard time believing existing. Employees and but I don't know are they part time permanent Are they part time temporary or. What sort of. Consular Service assistance we have type of job descriptions. Thank you for your thoughts. Your stuff of counsel services are like the members you know if they make it through the appointment process is that they have a job maximum for two years with the term of office of the members that's all there is no guarantee that they will or will be reappointed that is for the next council to make that determination for that term so all our employees know is that they have once. A resolution usually on the. First day of the term after inauguration. Is that if when I proven pacify the council that that meeting they have a job for two years and no more that's all we are allowed to grant them because that is a term of our office so their job is forty two years maximum and then they get reappointed or you don't there's no guarantee of the appointment. It's a white and just one last comment. I'm trying to stay within our existing level of expenditure and. Hold the council to the same standard that I've been trying to hold the other departments to. So my sense is that we. I don't intend to move on this real quickly but I think we have money with within which we can work that may not result Well it wouldn't result in us and it up with two new positions so I think if the members feel that they need to have that. They need two additional positions that they should vote for both of those and appreciate your comments any other comments members. Yes Miss Cochran. You know I mean I see the hard work they do and they definitely need assistance so I support your additions and if that is being offset with the item one or two were discussed and I'm OK with that or I'm looking at Mr victory you know to restore asking to restore the forty two five that could go with that analysts and my understanding of Mr victory I'm sorry for cutting in Mr Cochran is to. Yeah reduce the. You know the part timers and putting back the forty two favorite Mr victory you know. So you're correct and that one OK thank you and then as we were discussing that we do not a lot to particular descriptions or job descriptions I guess so the kind of comes out to say I mean if you just MINUSTAH if it's a secretary now listen just went to the numbers you put in the forty two five and take just the ad because it's the forty one thousand. To eighty five thousand dollars and thereby been vacant appropriate how they would like it could be for secretary Alice it could be for the party whatever so that's kind of how I'm just sort of factoring in the number and not looking at what it's for per se I mean it's you know who it's for and in a sense but that's just my calculated you know my head to even it up but I actually support your recommendations and I'm trying to understand how this will work up to for the Department. You know the appreciates. The sensitive issue that we currently have warm bodies bodies and positions. And you're providing the chair with exactly what you want that we think you know how to make improvements within our own branch at that was one of the key things I wanted to have as well is to reassure the our residents and our public that we review every budget just as thoroughly as. Apartments that we are fair in our overall but you take responsibilities even within our own homes. And so I thank you for members who are doing this difficult work but it's hard to look at others when we tell us we don't look at our own house I appreciate the scrutiny in the comments. Positions that you have shared to this discussion so saying that let's the way I would like them to move on after hearing the various comments and again Mr White was still have as I mean a street or. Two to choose office will have some ability to make adjustments internally within that category so I would see. I think the best compromise and yet this is within his purview as our own ministry to . Deal with the coming of books trying to keep funding all that I would say from a budgetary standpoint. To reduce council service assistance to forty two five The elite coming to the committee secretary at thirty three to one hundred six living under legislative analysts at forty one six one one. As as a way to compromise approach to this. From a budgetary standpoint it allows him basically the same amount of money. And we'll see how Mr White manages his area and can report back to the council for review we have consensus on that there's some sense of compromise thank you we'll move it forward. Was there any need to review on zero five one zero six we need small reductions in the equipment and operations. We've got to move forward. As the church understands it. We're OK with the audit through as we've done with France and we're done with Cooperation Council. We are now on preach six I believe. Has something for us for line one forty one. So this is the community work day program. And we had Mr De his here to chime in regards to my edition of fifteen thousand which would apply to. Recycle events in the West. This is the one where I didn't really figure out pinpoint this one forty one on forty one forty one and so I was looking at the eleven point nine part from insurance program itself insurance or. The emergency fund five million so I. Mean thousand is not going to. There's a types of I didn't know I mean that's my record and it was only place I could think of unless there's have a place in. Somewhere that could apply to this type of particular use not sure. I was. Aware or knew where to look for that well as the employment the protection part we have that's another. Venue for consideration by you in the community. I appreciate you looking at his general emergency fund. For the fun you looked at so for insurance off insurance so. I would see I appreciate your willingness to. Be open how you look at for any cash so. Is there a one way. So we can make a decision one way or India that which would you prefer. If there's something in the environmental protection and I sure would a fight. With petroleum is there and I would say that. It's a chair is the office of Mr Mr Schumer. Solid waste division they have funds for county grants subsidies that maybe you could put fifteen thousand dollars. On one of those items and put a proviso that it be for. Monthly recycling events in West. Keith thank you for under public or. They're. Just not in this picture Mr Molina. I suppose I'm sorry. Page nine. This exhibit one and it has the Environmental Protection stain ability program where the. Item could be provided if you'd like to provide that or remove that money. This and put it into that. They would be linked to thirty eight. We currently have four point one seven five million dollars in this part of. This is under environmental protection the sustainability program so that we waste management fun . After our adjustments we are now at four point one seven five billion dollars I don't think. That banks that OK Do you have a proviso rating yes. Provide fifteen thousand. Vents in law. To collect household recyclable electronics and recycling to help his community recycle needs so I think decrease in wording but that's the gist of it. I guess I believe their legal name is still community work. But been calling themselves. However they just want to make sure they legally recognized name yes. That's OK Thank you for my for your thousand words what we say member. Lane. Three yes who is somewhere between two through to thirty. A request they miss Cochran for a proviso fifteen thousand dollars and it's to create for West. Once a month recycling program regarding I guess white goods. That's the term I guess was for the plains is on the white goods. Just so you want to. Weigh in with its. Various. Members do you need further clarification on the purpose of the proviso Are we clear we clear on what she is proposing as a chair Mr Moreno just to clarify whether the proviso would be directly for community work day or if it's just a general this would be through community work yes to that specific case of a similar. To community work from this point as a specifically for the West once a month recycling and program that particular entity. So not it. Is there any need for further clarification. So we have. Much thank you very much that's why we place a. Plane one seven zero. We have. The issue of administrative overhead charges. You know this is ALL issue for all of us it's our No I don't care what we do yeah I think Mr White. Said he wanted to bring it up later OK. I have it written down because I was just going to try to work on the other stuff but where are we in the midst of all seven one seven zero eight seven. Because it was going to pass that would pick up the rate study and work with Mr Abbas after budget. So the next lane then maybe Levy is one eight zero. Or which position is currently vacant it's at the operations manager the superintendent position. That's the operations superintendent is vacant and what did the respond we go I mean if you could live without one I think he wanted to maintain the plant manager because it was a failed position. OK. You heard the response from the departments regarding this. So the chair would just say that I would support that there were after that we can delete one plane as do we delete one eighty and restore one eighty one. Mr Chair Mr coach there might be some confusion among staff and administration if it was the other way around. It's a boss and Q. Yeah Mr Chair Thank you and I believe that the director. Required the superintendent position. And I'm sure he'd want both but if. You know he would require request the superintendent position. He agreed to Mr Necker go on his comments given this past Wednesday March twenty. Eighth. He says. On page two of his return response includes a salary for the plant manager and it is all five treatment plants. Currently exists in this position if not this position person may not have funding for his position so it is a request to maintain the plant manager position and. The superintendent. And I referred to Mr Necker go was written testimony to this committee miss at risk. So that's what I would say. To that. One eighty and we restore one eighty one. Consensus consensus thank you for it restoring one eighty one and if you would be leading one. We had a request to review premium pay on one three is there a proposal by any members. Consensus Kate we have written down as we visit but I don't know. The consensus consensus let's move on thank you. Request to come back to. Sixty nine for ninety three but if there are any but for the committee to consider but Lang of one community we have consensus on eighty four. Yeah thank you and say do we want to be five right yet and I said yeah I want to keep the right thank you members this is my last move forward. Page eight line one I need to this is under the solid waste management fine. The civil engineer three expansion I have this is a. Revisit Is there any proposals for the committee to consider. Should like to propose to put that back and use general funds this is under assault the waste management Mr I'm sorry solidly behind it yes solid waste management. We have any other proposals Mr White. Just state that from the department's. Position that of all the things that we cut that's their number one priority to right. That's why I said I'm open to proposals put a back. Story yes. Yes you need to look. Members solid wastes. Get the money into solid waste management fund. Do we have consensus yet into this. Weekend We story. Start putting on our hats thinking hats are we going to pay for this one. The next one I have. Is on Department of Finance. Yes Mr Before we go too far I believe we've got a whole lot of two twenty eight twenty nine. Thirty seven and I have a proviso. For two thirty eight in. OK. Twenty eight this is under solid waste. Management. Regarding premium reduction of premium paid Mr Coach I believe in Mr White correct me if I'm wrong I think that was their next. I can look it up here too but I believe that was one of their requests high priority requests. Their second request was. The restoration of the. Landfill and that gave them. That mark down. Premium pay was their number three and their request in. Forty eight their original number was two ninety seven they're requesting to forty eight this it gets a little fuzzy because we've given them one of the attendants and oh right and they so I would suggest we restore. Half of what we took out. The great. Mr White's recommendation members any. Twenty four to twenty eight ma'am twenty two twenty eight for premium. Talk about the landfill Yes and Mr Wade is recommending that we store a half of the. Recommended cut. Questions. That is correct so that will be cut in half the reduction so we have consensus. Thank you very much this is a. Solid waste fund. I just want clarification on true for. Central Maui land attendant there. OK because I was OK I had so much scribbles and turned him over we did or not yet OK OK Yeah I was think you for that. Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and I I believe that was one circled on mine but. I don't have a number next to it with. A present one of the one of the party Well it's yeah it's one of their priorities but it's also one of the areas in which there's lots of contracts with some encumberances remaining so. I've gone over a whole lot of numbers and. That's almost too much information so I think what I would like to do is I was going to recommend restore and half of that. Half of the operations I'm out to thirty seven and then. I'm happy to spend the time between now and first reading to go back and work with the department and make sure that. It's appropriate. If we make those two restorations with what we've. We've restored. You want to weigh in rough numbers it puts us at a number that's a little short of what they had last year but as you recall they had about a little over a million dollars in. Future years and they have. Switched some of their contracts so they're more year to year but. I'm comfortable if we make those restorations and then I'll go back and it leaves short of where they were last year but I'm I'm reasonably comfortable with that I'll take the time between now and first reading to verify consent. So that is. Three seven members. Two nine three seven restoration. Fifty percent of the proposed reduction correct any further comments we have consensus consensus that we did get consensus on did we not yes yes that is half any reste we restore enough of a. Share map where is thirty seven about. Restoring Taurean half or so that we would get that number in half the seven forty nine so that's fifty percent restoration Yes OK. So again members this is in the solid waste. So you need to just keep it in the staff is keeping track. Just once in the fund so when we. Look at for a way how we're going to pay for this is going to be from special phones. Anything else. I wanted to add a proviso. If at all possible and an increase but Lang. Probably to thirty nine cents or out of room. Sensually I want to say. I want to increase. Restoring operations about ration percent yeah so that's fine so I will add the proviso that one hundred twenty six thousand shall be used to continue this or you can program to approximately one thousand seven hundred. Fifty existing customers. I also and I don't know where we would do this I mean I think when we talk rates and fees I also would like to see that we increase I believe we've calculated this figure at six dollars a month for each one of those. Fees. But can we do it. Separate seven hundred fifty folks. The rate would be on for you know more like. I mean. That we could structure it is under rates and fees and do the. Areas. That. Are guiding can plan. OK so any of those that. We don't need to make it. But only those that have that program will have that rate so if you don't average you don't get it. But that would be under rates and fees. Or you've missed your coach who gets to have. In reaching fees. Members. Thank you Mr Chairman I just wanted to know that the three can plan operations is currently in the operations program in the. Diversion section currently or the Environmental Protection sustainability the reason why is because it's operated by a refuse collection people OK And then then I would move it to one to thirty two and my staff was correct. They usually are yes. And that would be done out of the seven. To nine. And. That's fine and I'm also part of that what I would I would like to make sure that there is. A department with an exacto model because I've heard numbers vary and I want to say it was right or wrong but I've heard a number so I'd like a record number from the department what they want to charge as far as the rate what they think it should be. Yeah but I just want to make sure I'm sorry but my dollar amount because I provide yes I support the discussion of race if you would be would it in that component I'm just more concerned at this point in time where we are with the proviso. That for one hundred twenty six thousand. And thirty two thirty two lines it's all the way. It's always operations program you heard the Mr coach for your. One hundred twenty six thousand yes. Mr White. I would suggest that if we're going to add a fee for this that it had in the cash. Yet we're going to need to make adjustments on the refs. So yeah I was. I wasn't sure whether he was making they are making a proviso on existing amounts or was whether he was saying there was at a nine hundred twenty six thousand and proviso that yeah that's a good question and just sticks I want to make sure that that extra fee is charged and then so we should add to the CASH Yes is my thing is this is under sold and therefore it will Yeah and therefore it will. Offset the cost yes so that. Should take your one twenty six. It's going to be an optional add on to the presidential month service so it's going to be you know if there are three can plan that's it. That will be a mandatory fee they want the three can plan program. It's not an option whether the going to be a requirement that you want this plant you will pay the additional six dollars fee per month for her question is there are seven hundred fifty. Customers now that have it because it was an optional but there was an extra charge now her question is can people opt in or out and the department said that they did not want that because it would be very logically cumbersome so it is not an option either I mean if you're on the three cam plan route you're on now I am I have cleared it with the chair I am going to send out. A questionnaire to each one of the those seven hundred fifty people and if they overwhelmingly come back and say no sorry then by first or second reading I'll remove that. So any need for further clarification members coaches proposal. Is their consensus and census. And will make the appropriate adjustments under bridges for this fun. They will bring back under rates in the rate specific rate. Anything else in this area members. Of those move forward. Under Department of Finance plane to fifty three. We've already supported the. The positions of great manager and we currently have that to be situated within the office of the MER I knew the lane I don't we created for the budgets that and the budget director and the grass manager and Mr vos. We've made no decisions so is there any proposals regarding the capital and fix assets and all this. Mr Chair I but I thought we had a consensus we were not on the cap but I fixed assets and all this we have I think consensus on the grants manager OK I'm sorry if I have it written down as consensus as both I mean not have deleting the capital and fixed assets analysts. So let's move forward and thank you. Notes is. There any need to operations in equipment accounts program. We did have a revisit both of those revisit certainly on the equipment for the grants manager but that's now going to be in Mr Baez's So Mr Bowen a moment's. Yeah I think it's fair discussing it with staff when we get the budget program together than requesting the equipment be in there as well so you have a figure three thousand dollars listed here was for that position. For the one and nothing for the capital for excess this position I'm sorry I sat right. I'm sorry it's a little late yeah half of it was yeah we're going to if we could make it fifteen fifteen or two thousand they can get them a desk to maybe. I don't know where I went I don't need no executive desk no. I'm happy to restore half the amount of the census we have what is it here or is it in his transfer. Just missed the key is whether or not you want to provide him some equipment money that I do but we wouldn't we would reduce equipment three thousand here but then we would have to add in the mayor's office is that correct will do that that's correct but this is all general fund so there's something that we were getting funding you know. It's going to be a big issue. Now Mr Chair I did have a. Revisit. Operations I don't know who said it but I had it anyone has a proposal for consideration to the committee going ups. Every night let's move forward. So. You get to know you. Stage where the chair gets more and more energy. So I am. At this point in time. Under. The next would be in the Treasury. Area members to eighty three to eighty three that's me. I was requesting the expansion position for the top three just just being having that experience just going down there during the circuit breaker time and then recently. They were requesting for an additional expansion position and my. Reasoning is if we're going to expand the R.P.T. Positions for collection purposes as well you're going to need. That counting side to keep up with that. They're part of the a collection fees. OK thank you for your thoughts Mr Goodman I support any other comments. The challenges we have with the Treasury Department I don't think it's a staffing issue like I can't support this because he's. Sorry. Chair hit each to scratch. It happened so in. Looking at running totals. Any further discussion regarding the expansion position it's going to go. Do we have consensus OK we don't have to wait doesn't support it so. Sense from the committee Mr. You support this. Two eighty three line to eighty three. So continuous a coach. Expansion position of clerk three for treasury which is yes and. Thank you. Miss Cochran. Miss shy Miss Kobo Yeah Mr Wade no. Yes we thank you Mr victory no yes. Votes No but this best is with play for. You know I can tell you when we do the review of Treasury after budget we'll see where that. Will pan out. And Mr Chair just to go along with that was the equipment for that position yes. But the bottom line to line to eighty six. Fifteen hundred two hundred thousand. Five hundred thousand one thousand going to get half consensus. At this. Point. And the reason for Texas. That see. This which I had a note for and may be wrong but a Financial Services Program Operations there was a revisit. To sixty four no. Lie about that. And that's before is. Believing then in the next year it would be Department of Fire get. Into administration do they have any proposals Mr Chair on line three forty five yes. I think we talked about this a little bit but I just wanted to. Bring it up again is that I'm fine with leaving the information communication manager but I think the chief has asked for a number of years for the secretary three so I'm. I'm supportive of at every story in that position. Mr coach is. To bring back sic at Terry three position. Staff. It's got to be somewhere if you ask the secretary three it's twenty eight thousand four hundred fifty six dollars. That's the eight month number yes it is. OK thank you very much. For the number you heard from staff if you want to restore a secret every three expansion with requests. For And yes Mr Smith on Chief Murray's list that us said restore he's going to have a restart for six months at twenty one thousand three hundred forty two. It's. Like that. Again you know members it's just that you know I'm not concerned about the first. This is the civil service potentially for evah operation continuing costs including benefits so that is more of the issue than the twenty one or twenty thousand to displace it in the budget it's about the continuing impact on operating that he's basically almost eternal and he's come he's going to be around. So any additional comments Mr Wait this is the department that has had the most significant increase in payroll costs of any department in the in the county. And I realize that it's not just the Chiefs responsibility but. I have a very difficult time expanding secretary of positions where I really don't believe it's necessary I can't support either the positions based on. What I consider a bit of overexpenditure approach in large US you have. Situation where a number of years ago we had three battalion chiefs and they added three more and you would think that overtime would be reduced but instead the overtime for just six people and the battalion chief category. Amounts to one hundred eighty one thousand dollars per year so if they would like to if the secretary is that critical. Out of some of your overtime so. You need anyway I mean. I can't support the increases here. And it's kind of you know if you noticed that you know even even after. Your adjustments and just in this administrative category they're two hundred thousand dollars higher than they were last year. I just have a very difficult time with that this is not a big section of the department and there are two hundred thousand dollars over thank you thank you yes I thought we need some appropriate adjustments Mr coach and I I understand and I'm fine with that but I thought we had to up or down the position count so. You know if they can't find the money that's fine we can do it with no salary and then they can find the money but we need to give them the position you know I'm not supporting the position either. Thank you so I guess you support the position he willing to go without the fund that's fine. Any other comments so. A lot of money I'm just trying to get a sense because they have heard from members and if. Approaches some just asking visit any of the comments or. You want to start with a chair Yes Mr Cochran. Create positions or I mean we're in charge of the money the dollars per se and not so much. To How I mean how some areas but for this if we because we did it in council services where. It is we don't we don't like using in South America and under counsel for fire there isn't. Really a person that would help people with basically means they have civil service positions means we do something we think it's forever OK. And so I would say as your chair I appreciate but. I understand the. Comments from Mr coach as well as I understand the fiscal issue that Mr Wade has I would see eventually this will be like the hospital there come a point where it's going to be too expensive and we are going to look at private partnerships potentially for this and if we keep going and growing the expense the way we have the last few years was just to carry over time. Sick Leave I think you know for this part I mean we need. Some kind of like sixty four additional firefighters to take care of the vacation sick when the regular positions so. It's going to be an expensive. Department unless we make. Considered changes in either country or how we want to approach fire safety like other counties Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and I just. Keep forgetting that we went to the council I do want to put the position in for twenty one K. Because. I believe the B.C.S. Premium is in a different completely different program so. And I don't know that we have enough you know premium pay would be under Carl but the B.C.S. Is but the chiefs is that on the ministration under administration no. Operation operations. But this isn't the this isn't a second term for a battalion chief. And there's there's plenty of premium pay in this department so over five million dollars in administration in the whole deployment on the whole department Well yeah but we can't move it around we can now at this point we can well yeah we can. Dismiss Cochran I'm referring to your hand. Pretty simplified in the. US and it's in reference to. Your deductions. So I guess. It's left with one point five mil. Well actually says Administration slash maintenance program yeah. Two point three three million. Two point nine one two million. Recommendations with the reductions. I give the this program area two point five three million which is about two hundred thousand more than the current budget year. But where in which accounts now we if we if we are having to budget by accounts we have to know which account yes. Is reduction of thirty six thousand two hundred. Sixty three seventy three. Counties sixty three zero seven two and sixty five zero. It's in your hand on line at three forty five three forty six three forty seven and three forty eight . That is your A.B.C.'s. So we have a proposal by Mr Coe which the secretary three physician your fruit comments from Mr White there anymore comment. Yes. This is. The secretary for. His proposal that is twenty one. Thousand AD and add twenty one thought was in three forty two which is what the chief is recommending forty six months position in the first and then it will go to forty forty two six eighty four for the full year in the succeeding budget. So any other comments. Mr Carroll you support this or you don't support the expansion for administration of fire Secretary three thank you that you're with a dozen He nodded affirmatively that he's going to need to speak up for the record you please misplace OK Thank you Ms Cox friend. Mr Coach I thank you Ms. Mr Lloyd. Mr I Mr. Chair votes no this passes this will be reinstated at six six six supporting. The Chair Thank you sir thank you for this breakdown to I guess we're going to need to be needing to use it quite a bit as we move forward THANK YOU THANK YOU chair. It's. A WHITE Mr. Which means we had him back which means you're going to need to find more money. Anything else Mr coach. Any other proposals regarding this program here and that's not going to move on training program any proposals for the chair. And the current year budget is one point two eight three million. American men and one point four nine nine million in the chair is recommending one point one three million. So just to clarify to decrease of nine hundred eighty nine thousand last year's appropriation I am working I recommend the A.B.C. Reductions one nine hundred six for premium paid to thirty eight for for seven for B. Account and forty seven five hundred for the C. Account of a QUESTION Yes Mr. Big because of the. Yeah requirements and. If they go over again they come back and. They can always request midst of us for a budget member in consideration I mean they need to pass the internals of. Requirements of Mr Baez and whatever they ministrations before we get to read it I want to review it if it gets that's Is there a litmus test and then gets approved to be sent to counsel but then we need to convince Mr Bosphorus the budget. Thank you Mr K. Yes I did hear all that you. Have any proposals. Have been that Mr move forward chair Mr coach you had to turn up kind of program he. Instituted that in here where you're going to end. Yet and what are the equipment we're going into. I mean the turn outs I've ministration I made adjustments as I said. Department had asked for one time and wide. The program areas for the turnout. My thing is I'm asking you to consider it from a multi-year freezing in I think currently to Cherry's Bill. A three year freezing or two year freeze in. Miss year she more. Yeah I think it's. It's fifty percent fiscal years sixteen fifty percent fiscal year seven I think that's what has turned. The department store and. I don't see your. Training. Show up then according to your reckoning I'm asking that it be done in a multi-year phase three and so make sure. Consider the remaining balance for the turnouts those are the kind of because I may have a year or so for. Back up to. Half of them. I mean. Thank you Mr Chairman just to clarify for the train program the turn outs are then a fight in the equipment account and for this training program the turnouts had not been reduced the reductions were to the bottles as well as the ultrasonic cleaner thank you thank you for that well you know. It's your. Turn out in force and we're already past administration so hopefully. Cheap doesn't have to go up to one of those but it seems like in reading your hand out here that. Has your details it's seems like you've deleted all turn outs not half but. Well if you look at these deleted. Some of the turnouts. Were to go you would get. Page five of your deal that says delete turn outs but the first one is. The request was forty thousand five hundred in the change was forty thousand five hundred delete so that seems to be all to me. The reduction was I was to leave on a various stations so some stations had all deleted other stations all provide. Stations so. It was there was no magic I think the first. Four stations. Got it this year and then the second for that in the land up that was got to OK It's OK to peers that it's. OK I think the mystery for you might be fresh in that you thank you so next year the position is if you support this will find the balance of the cut the stations in half half will get it this year next year the other half of the stations will get their turn off because we thought it was better to deal with stations now there's a hole so we split the stations. In half Miss Cochran thank you. Reflect and support the. E-mail that was sent. From Chief Marie and I had to do with helmets. Expires this year and this is all in compliance relations as he stated so this is not reflecting his comments in his email to us for helmets because I guess if it's a compliance and they expire this year. And then turn out six but so he can kind of breaks it down yes I wanted. It's in reference to what he's suggesting or something seems to me like something we can't really fight over. Yeah I can see the payments through that the magic word for this committee is complaints. Chair I I think from when I'm looking at what we got from. You know where it's easier to get only a portion but I think he says No I mean yes you know and I am happy that the chief gives us feedback because their input is. Assisted comedian making better decisions. So again. Mr Molina Can you share helmets are in the account for the training program and their medical safety supplies and that you had proposed to reduce to provide as he said to provide only half of the helmets requested and then. Yes Mr Cochran brought up that response from the chief the can you give us a the date of the correspondence of these today yesterday April thirtieth. So in that he states. All one hundred percent of the helmets expire on the same time. He says. This year two thousand and fifteen. Replace F Y sixteen. Stating. That we appreciate the Chiefs input. Yes Mr what. I recalled that we requested the chief check the expirations. Turn outs and. I would like to suggest that we I believe we cut. More than half of the turnouts so I would like to suggest that we go back and and rest and have staff adjust. The turnouts to where we're providing half this year and half next year because it is concerned was that most of them might be expiring this year and I think we do half this year and half next year. That should accommodate their needs and I would support your. Splitting of the helmet cost as well or how about replacement you know. As I read the. Communication from Mr Bush to committee staff. With. That transmits the chief's comments. The chief says he. Understands the split on the turnout's. Half over two year period. That can be done. By the committee his only concern is that all how much expert this year into those in fifteen so he says we need it for in the fiscal year two thousand and sixteen. So. We are going to maintain members with no objection from the you know the turn outs in the manner that the chair has recommended in half speed up the stations in half. I would last if we have consensus he will take the Chiefs. Return response is that he did his due diligence and that is all his helmets will expire this year. And can also ask for a commission to do their review. So you see more noticeable You know the lead story thank you Mr Chair staff would just like to know one. One change that had not been addressed under this same adequate safety supplies from F Y fourteen there was an increase for boots this increase was in the medical and safety supplies item throughout the various programs of the Department. That reduction for the one time purchase for Boots was never made and so just to point out that that might be an area to adjust to a. Number of Mr movie and. Have to double check but it's approximately several hundred thousand dollars throughout the whole program. OK So Mr White Yeah I would I would recommend that we make that reduction and that will offset the turnout so we're going to have to increase the helmets. But the concern is how the helmets but I mean it's right now OK So members. You heard Mr Molina share with us that there was a one time requests which we did fund we are going to make that adjustment and in reduction through the department and then use that difference to address. The need from the other. Components of the unbudgeted helmet requirements and there is an issue to the chair missing. And not in particular to this this. Helmets and all that OK. If I mean. Under its. Budget seven and I think we. You didn't make any change did you make any change you know and. Yeah it's out. But we talked about. Apparatus standardized. You know I'm not sure if you were here with us the chief. What does that mean but what they're trying to do is standardize their training standardized equipment. No matter where you're going to if everything is standardized like a white male would have one separate. I don't mean to you. If we came in there it's all the same equipment and right now it's. It's a mishmash. But they haven't they're heading to standardise ations. I have to say this this support is coming from one of far our firefighters and. In the training area. Under the whip man. I'm looking. Under. The reductions to. See a car on the forty seven five hundred was reduced seen in half there are scuba bottles you have right and then levy the ultrasonic cleaner for the helmets at this time for this year's consideration so that's the two things that is reduced under equipment OK You know I was looking under other they've got it all different it's they didn't make any other adjustments and in this area misc Ravello three four. OK fine so members. Let me get back so that the staff is clear reduction of the one thing. So we're going to reduce that we're going to go up against. Requirement do fun. PUT IT department their new helmets we have consensus with. Yes Mr Cochran. I'm fine but I just want to make sure because I'm trying to figure out as Mr Wade had mentioned the success of my me in you know he's explaining and so even though we're not giving. Our group we could give a. Position and not the money because they can find somewhere within. I'm concerned if in this type of a. Give X. Amount of dollars to purchase they don't have anywhere to go fine or am I wrong is that why you feel you might be do have that that opportunity. Because you know I just meant with the helmet that I feel they got so that I mean I would like. Their attire to do their job and to be safe in what they do not for. Somebody have a pool in the boot or. Something I mean their attire needs to be up to par and I want to use a c word but you know everything and so I just want to make sure that if in case you need replacements they have some kind of money to go get to do it and not be totally. Blocked out and out of luck. So that's. You know and that's where the you know again I refer back to two chiefs Mary transmittal. That Mr coach referred to that was sent to Mr Burroughs he says he's OK with the turnouts in a two year freezing program and yes that we purchase helmets all at one time in the discouraged physically year sixteen's proposal and so I rely on that the chief OK. And I guess he's OK no boots yes money well he thought it was a one time request a slam so that's why I came at what he states to the committee OK I just want to be reassured. So we're on a training program which is on page fourteen top of the preach. So we'll make those adjustments already the consensus to just most of the boots and the helmets any at their proposals for the chair in this program area Mr Chair Yes May I have a short recess but you sure you can't you will have. Till twelve twenty the staff needs a breakthrough as we been going for three hours but that's. Thank you we show a return to work we saw it in the Department of Fire we're going to move to the fire rescue operations program. Or can you. Just have a sense of what we're doing and we were hit in. The chest before. And the real property tax takes into account the current budget year where we budgeted two hundred fifty three million under property tax for the general fund purposes if you use that as the base which is what the chair did you take five point five percent of that total. Ends up to the two hundred sixty seven. Chair used as his bases of revenue to create his proposal. So with all the general fund. Additions going to need to increase tax rates above the chairs pulls a five percent increase in. While it is still below. The merest proposal that proposal takes into account a five and a half percent increase as a starting point. So any future increases to the general fund we need to increase the percent of increase that are real property tax requirements to keep that as part of your considerations as we're going to figure out how we're going to pay for things. Under. Operation. The chair had put. In for a category. Three expense and positions and the reduction of premium. Is the reduction of operations and in the C.E.O. Is the reduction in the Quitman in this program area the chair is going to pose for consideration Mr white just to be clear that. The reductions that you have suggested with respect to just once boots and the turnouts in restored to have. Those are in operations so. Those You're already you don't need to discuss the turnout's or the. The boots boots yes OK but helmets the helm of the helmets. That's right the helmets are in each of. The small enough yet something you can share with the committee I believe the helmets are all in the training program thank you for that clarification so. By you consensus earlier we've taken care of the. Helmet issue here. By rescue I. Do I. Have consideration for parties. The apparatus standardizing aberrations. Administration. And then. Operation administration small but standard isolation so. I think that Cheney was to end up with fifty dollars. And the chief heirs like to restore says one hundred forty two years but I think he wants to restore the forty five as well as the one hundred . Thousand. And the. Value of that would be standardize ation is how the chief spleen to us. The importance of their turning over their. Equipment or even their will. Communication is standardizing everything so that it doesn't matter. If you're from coming from well OK or from. Fighting fire for a while here to. Everyone here is standardise. I personally want to support this on behalf of. A committed firefighter who is working was worked on standard a solution. By fighter yapping great Jenkins. I would like for us to reconsider and I think most of the members heard the chief explain. The importance of standardizing thank you for your requests. Members she wants to restore the food. Reduction of money for eight thousand one sixty two to one forty five one six zero which shows there would be under. One three six two. Yes. I just said well you know it was a chair also attached to the apparatus that there is a shirtless equipment. In the amount of one hundred and seven thousand dollars keys are you asking for that too or just the standard ice. She's asking for one hundred seven thousand and ninety five I thought was it one sixty. So again members have to figure out how you're going to do real property tax. We don't have consensus. We don't have consensus consensus on judges. And no. No no. So. Mr Carroll you want to restore all the money. You have expansion position no no no this is only regarding the standard days ation . Project under small equipment so that's what she's going to she's proposing to add back ninety five thousand one hundred sixty dollars as well as the one hundred seven thousand dollars that was for what they give Mr Molina. It was for the various equipment related to the stand isolation program. So it's hundred and seven plus ninety fight that was in one sixty. Eight it's Cochrane. Mr Coach it's cruel Oh yes Mr White No Mr victory no and the chair votes no. Off moves forward five three so. We can forward to your proposals for varying use. Anything else in this area. We're moving on. Mr Victorian Oh. OK. We're under fire prevention program. Do that is anyone have a proposal for the chair including funding. We're going to move on in safety. Reforms the status quo. Any proposal for the chair. Mr Cochran. Yeah I'm going to support your Because it's to keep it right keep them in parks. And until we get that contract come before us we ratify it and then we know exactly the terms and conditions the salary scale of the job descriptions if there is any step movements and then we can also take into consideration your requests regarding the operations and the. Concern at that time Mr Cochran. OK And. It takes equipment everything I would seize the scene because. I know there. Was a fire. Fire but I think couple of jet skis already this year as part of the budgeted equipment purchases. Mr Bond's comments. Stated Yeah you're correct but the. Consideration was for the. Vision of it's moving back to parks won't necessarily have access to those that fire but. I think that was this conference concerned. To ocean safety they do need that equipment. Basically one. A.T.V. And one truck and I don't know what this seventy thousand dollar truck is I mean I'd go for a standard we've been thirty grand or something not I don't know why it's seventy thousand it's the fire department and this is heart. You know this is you know this is for ocean sea it was going to be fire but it was an ocean safety vehicle and not like a fancy apparatus thing so. Yeah I'm in favor of keeping it but I really really need the that you quit meant to be in parks I guess now and this is a letter from. The director. Saying. You know would drop it even lower he's looking for three T.V.'s three vessel marine equipment and one motor vehicle seventy granite. And having spoken to the workers themselves what they can live with. Mr victory in his famous question is an A.T.V. And a truck so it brings it down. Pretty. So if I can have that. Or even a status quo she missed a movie no thank you Mr Chairman staff which just requests for tracking purposes if we can address those ads when we reach the parks department section and not in a fire section thank you. Cochran the chair would support the yes requests that when we go to parks that's when we'll make those considerations OK And so but. Even though the merger is not occurring here how about. That salary compensation portion I would say. That will be hard until we ratify the contract because in that country it would get all of the ranges on the compensation if they have step movements. Because of years of service we would know exactly the dollar amount and the best way for us to do salary adjustments so it wasn't looking for any it was there is a dollar amount figured in at one. Hundred three thousand just to pay for the rest of the physical I think I guess is what this is going to factor in with that two dollars and fifty cents per hour raise and like the other counties are currently doing without having that ratification occur at this point so that's what that Reza was that we all passed and also how I'm trying to factor that in now to reflect so that. Parks OK OK. Parks like so down which Fire Department of Housing and human concerns Well let's see what Blaine do we. Have three eighty eight. Is there is a proposal and funding. To be presented for committee. Consideration. Mr Chair I believe I had that. Was wanting to make that fifty percent reduction as opposed to the thirty five thousand reductions that seventy thousand. Missing. The department had requested fifty thousand dollars for a one time appropriation to hire a consultant for Section eight. And was a twenty thousand dollar contractual. Decrease. So instead of giving them all of that back I was I think my suggestion was to just give them half of that deduction of that they can get a better a better deal than great. You know one of the concerns that you chair has with this program area is. Like with Section eight and if you look at your. Program budget. Went through the pass what I think or maybe was into detail sheets I think. You will see notations that this is a federal grant program era especially if you got into Section eight. The burden of benefits is being carried by the general fund which the chair has issues with assessing the agreement regarding grant funding and as Mr Buzz says were fired for other programs that we have talked about earlier underground revenue those funds include the benefits the fringes I don't think it's fair what I think X.P. Is. But this county to be pain free is under general fund for federal grants or used that are on a limited term appointments. Because that general fund monies we can currently in this night use it to take care of some of the restoration Yes we should have available for us for consideration and that use for federal limited term fringe benefits. That is a great displeasure to the chair at this time all right I know Mr Buzz is now working with the church to get this addressed in a very near future so I just want to say that. I ministration Mr Baez's on this issue we are going to work on this together to ensure that we can give relief to the general fund expense but that is currently not what Sept twenty Mr White. To your point. Added up what each of those items are noted how much of the friend was carried by the general fund and I believe in the. Special fund that we get what we're carrying is about one point two million dollars and it's. At most of us of all is thought that when we get federal or state funds that it covers the salary and the fringes but that's not the case. So. You know I don't know what the final solution on how we're going to deal with it whether we have positions so that the balances can pay for the fringes of the remaining employees but. Mr understands that she is concerned that we reduce the impact on the general fund for this missing any comments. No thank you Mr Chair and I appreciate the working with you on resolving this it wouldn't quite be one point two million dollars it be more about five hundred sixty thousand or so is what our calculations are for the fringe benefit costs for the staffing in section eight and you know Section eight is one of those programs that we've had for decades. And it's never paid its fringe benefit costs it's never been budgeted in there so. When we started discussing this issue. A couple of years ago that's when we started working on you know what is it that they're budgeting for and how can we work on making sure that they're paying their fringe costs so I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on that I think you missed the bus space so thank you. It's just that we never budgeted Yes that's correct OK thank you thank you and just a clarification the one point two million was not just today it was Section eight and several programs follow. Understand how you reach your goal because they were very. Transparent Mr Buzz's staff did make those specific comments at the bottom of those details sheets so they were very upfront with the committee Yes sir coach. I'm just trying to figure out how that works into my revisit. I just want you to know that. On the operations part of me. How to offset that general fund use for fringes and in this fragile areas that for me should be more in. County programs that is far were directly employees costs and their fringes gotcha. Because if I mean you know part of the spread if we reached the success that the program gold is it will be no need for Section eight company in the county if we reach the goal of getting housing for people within reasonable means the struggle just means they should be working themselves out of a job to be successful. To maintain your. Lane item. So. That you have your proposal Mr. Coach you want to reduce this by half correct. So you who we have consensus. With the care of you support the reduction in half that Mr coach is proposing. Thank you myspace is Cochran you know Mr Coach I. Yes Mr White Mr Guzman. Mr victory you know. That you will vote no so this moves forward six three under grants and disbursements for the affordable rental housing programs is there for the chair. Yes Mr Chair unless somebody else wants to do it I know several of us had concerns in the discussion OK. We heard from testifiers and. Several testifiers for this organization and when I asked you weren't there and I asked one of the questions that you had your your concern was why is there only four groups that are involved in this and they said they've reached out to other people and and have not gotten any bites and nobody has come to them and asked for assistance but this is the four. Groups that will help with rental assistance so people don't and they coordinate it so people don't game the system and go to all four different places and get rental assistance four times four. Out of two hundred eighty five I think he said two hundred eighty five clients altogether which is quite a bit. They had to that that came through the cracks because of. Different surnames and whatnot so I think it's a great record and the more we can help these folks get rental assistance we heard the stories that testimony of the actual people that got Reynolds distance I think . You know where we're putting money in the fight homeless or putting money in to help social services and this is a really good one to give people hand a hand up so. I'm willing to increase the general fund by removing this. Recommendation restoring Yes restoring me reduction thank you for the comment was a bus Mr Cheney had asked for a breakdown of the. Level of funding for each of the four agencies. For three hundred twenty eight thousand five hundred Family Life Center was two hundred seventy five thousand women helping women lose one hundred seventy thousand and. One hundred seventy thousand. Totals up to nine forty three five hundred. Forty three five hundred. OK thank you for that Mr Bowser We appreciate your assistance to the community. And Mr be willing to go to that nine forty three five hundred. And removing the proviso That's my. You know the proposal the church has no problem removing the providers of is there any we have consensus on that if I was consensus yeah that's fine with the chair. So I guess everything I've changed my. Offering to be restored to nine forty three five hundred research to a total of forty three from OK you've heard Mr coaches proposal. And I understand your argument which the chair when you see I hope when we come to terms with the rates we don't put some of our current people into the spread get. The current tax bills understand that we do have a. Minimum Tax Rate and circuit breaker so. That's what that's for. We've been hearing you've got the responses like the responses from the beast. Thank you and I recall discussion mentioned the concern also and correct me farmer I don't put words in your mouth sir but. It was it it was a. Discussion amongst the four the same four year after year and they figure out who gets what when and how. Then Today's this money says they reach out but for me I think the thing was who's running the show here where's the department of housing director involved here because it was stated and then they came up with. For and said We reached out and we never so. And it was Salvation Army and Life Center and I think. Very So I don't know what the dialogue is but I would be hard pressed to think they wouldn't want a piece of pie some kind of income to help assist their functions to. That well I would see I think the department is well aware of some of the issues we're brought up. And I am going to expect improvements in this area we're going to oversight from the Department. And also we will have a new department director come July first. Ever is going to assume the responsibilities of the record industry apartment is going to deal with needs to deal with this challenge and I will say that at this point in time we're going to stand is I'm willing to give the new director an opportunity to address it prior to the next budget and if. It doesn't get addressed to this committee's. Approved. Satisfaction at the chair has no problem instituting corrective measures in the next budget. Mr I just. I mean it's causing for myself I support your recommendation. It's my understanding that the Department of Housing and human concerns does facilitate this part process this and it's not just them all meeting by themselves if Mr Baez can buy that I'm not sure he can or not I think we had enough. Thank you I think the department what we're looking for the agencies there they're here they're hearing the comments so I think they're going to work the word back to make sure that it becomes a more acceptable. And satisfactory. Program arrow for the scum eighty. So I am willing to allow them till the next budget cycle. The consensus. So again. Members Mr coach is so moving just to name forty three five hundred and you know there are comments is there a consensus on this number content for the senses. Mr Coach I mean the Mr Carroll are you. Supporting thank you miss by so I miss Cochran the sickout has caught Ravello I support OK Thank you Mr White. Mr Goodman Mr victory no Kate thank you this moves forward seven days and two knows so thank you very much. Let's go to Lane three nane. We didn't we were killing three ninety seven and we got consensus that C. Four zero four. Early childhood resource program operations. Any proposals for the committee that I wanted to. Have us restart this is I believe that's the one thousand five hundred ninety and I did not have a chance to check with the. Early childhood. Party leader with human concerns. I think it's. That yeah I'd like to see that we start. This is a reduction from fifteen thousand so they get ninety four at the current. Where the chair so you for admits it was requests in addition no. Comments by the members. Mr Goodman thank you I ask questions so if if we restore that line for all five is that required as well to restore the equipment No it doesn't necessarily know how. Or if I guess. We have consensus on. So. Let me just leave it for you there are four at this time. And the other. For creation of points you folks want to make on this. On line for zero four but. None of the money from that line has been spent so far and they said they're going to spend by the end of the air but I just don't see this as a necessary expansion. Thank you for sharing that it's a check for that. So any other comments. Is there consensus on this and don't believe in keeping the reduction of fight. But you think you're thinking about the proposal OK there is no proposal because there are four So yes consensus. Consensus can thank you for what you claimed for his zero five. Section of equipment. So absent. For. The next page sixteen. You would do it lane for one three. For the committee to consider reinstate. And three hundred seventy nine. I don't agree with. Mr Chair. To. F Y fifteen levels or did they not require I can't remember if these folks requested a. An increase their proposal is eighty eight two hundred. And my recommendation is current levels eighty three eight twenty one. Their proposal being the preschools this is just a law school yes it was a one yes we only have one from the island but it was their proposal not the marriage proposal. This is Mr bus. Thank you Mr yes they did requesting OK. I know I don't remember I was. Like I wasn't there. Yet so. Do you want some general discussion of how you want to approach this in the more comprehensive way or you want to do one at a time one at a time because we did go through and do some consensus on on stuff that people didn't ask for increases. And you didn't take away either so. Victory No I just I'm ready to vote on. This point if we just ask for the commitment all the. Restoration I just would rather just vote on it there's not much to discuss to ask for a yes or no thank you. Consensus. That's right yes. Content to say was very much on the chairs. Yes Mr. Big three hundred wants to increase the location to eight hundred. No. Mr Carroll do you support the increase for the grant myspace site Yes Mr Cochran. Which Mr Covello. Mr White know Mr Goodman Mr victory in oh yes votes no. Eighty three a twenty one. K. Early childhood accreditation this is a new year requests one hundred twenty five thousand. Is there any proposals for that year. No. Thank you early childhood programs began restoration answer one fifty three but do you guys keep. Mr Richter in is recommending restoring. To the mayor's proposal one fifty three the chair is one of three which is the current year's funding level. Is that Carole you support this. Approach or do you support restoring one fifty thousand dollars online for twenty two for early childhood program. Misplaced Yes Miss Cochran Mr Coach I just.

And that's a restoration Yes sir returned the money back yes Miss miss by Rick requests is to place the sixty five hundred. In space on this Cochran Mr coach is Covello Yes. No Mr Goodman Yes Mr victory and yes. This moves forward with five. Supporting it so we stored this to one seventy five. Ryan four four two this is a new requests. From feed my sheep nany. I'm sorry let me know if you feel sorry at that in my for. My apologies thirty eight Is there any proposals for the committee. I'd like to. This is the program that Cameron Senate Emil abounds thank you for the requests from Miss place. Any other discussion members are going to want to bring up Mr. I support this is well Mr Chair it's. These are all good programs so. I'm fully supportive of it yet the question is not whether it's a good program it's the amount of fund I understand to provide OK so I know we don't have consensus so Mr Carroll. Thank you. Mr Cochran Mr coach Mr Covello Yes Mr White Mr. Mr victory in. This most forward with six supporting it so we store it. Line for forward to feed my sheep This is a new requests for ninety eight thousand one seven zero. Mr victory you know I would like to. Recommend thirty five thousand to this program to give them opportunity to get started and. You know what our commitment to feeding the very needy out there and we do it for other organizations. I know it's a big chunk of what they wanted but I think it's a good starting point so I would record my recommendation is thirty five thousand. OK You heard a proposal from Mr De Reno any further discussion Mr. Chair This is one of those organizations that has. A lot of volunteers a huge reach they never asked for money before and they got. I think I recall no paid staff but this is so this is one of the areas that I think. I can support I'm very familiar with their operation and. So I would I would. Mr victory in those recommendation. To at least I'd like to provide them two thirds of them out or call it sixty sixty five thousand dollars. And then they get. Here. I'm trying to say what I think in a not to get a gun ban that's like I could get it but if consensus. Do it and say. We don't have consensus Mr Carroll. Let's so you can be clear because this proposal is Mr victory you know recommend it thirty five and you moved it up to I defer to sixty five. Not I just need efficacious so that we know what number we are correct we will be in the Senate. Carol. I think you misplace I mean Cochran I Mr coach is. You know it's the weight I mean I don't miss a victory and. It's most Ford would support let's move in on. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars. Is there any proposals for the chair. We're going to move or miss by so yeah I would like to get the money back if we can . Thank you for the proposal from misplace a story two hundred fifty thousand dollars. Let's call them a conditional comments the chair doesn't like this to be a recurring requests. That's my issue I see this as a recurring requests I don't have a problem with you know maybe supporting it to get them ability to get other funds but. I don't want to carry this position for. Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and I believe this was for physician assistants to get some physician to stay here. But I thought Mr Craig said it was a one time. One time and I would have supported it if it was a one time. Did we have their frustration on that stuff because that's not what they read in my thinking. Since you're here if you have no objection to your objection Mr Craig if you would. Come forward and if you can respond to the cheers question whether this is a one thing requests only or this will be a recurring request before this committee Absolutely I think my written testimony reflects that. Sorry I haven't spoken in two hours or. Less What that this one time request a thank you. This should not be carried forward after the this year and my hope is that the legislation that was passed to give the hospital an opportunity to partner with some other larger systems will help us fix this problem for good. If we gave you half in to do to match it with the new system of the current system is that something doable so that again I'm sorry if if we see. To give you half and that we would require a match for me to the whole system more than you suppose the partnership. Is that a workable option. What I would say is we would be happy with anything that you could give us towards this week These are dollars that we have to shell out ourselves so we will have to start selling them out. At the beginning of your Actually we have to start selling them out now. It's an ongoing thing for us we've been doing this for six or seven years. You know the questions for me is to create myspace so. I don't I don't remember this every being but I hear it talked about a lot this. Time. One time and I don't think I'm writing but we talk about it. OK Anything for Mystic creek at this time and others disagree we thank you very much for your kids it's an assistance to the committee Mr Coach thank you Mr Chair and I understand what. This bicyclist trying to say but the proviso only lasts for this year and a way so it won't be we want to see it so going to be going to rely on Mr Molina as steel trap memory to. Thank you. You know looking at there are so many to us and. What the chair what I've heard from misplaces proposal. I'm happy to. Consider this. But I would. Consider that they go out and do some matching requirements either one for every two hours or one for one but. I'm happy to give them some support to assist them in getting squared away but also for them to do additional fund raising from other opportunities including Since my understanding is that the revised bill to private things that we hospital says is going to the floor for action by both houses I passed but how so thank you for the updated status so this will be moving toward a partnership and I think there's opportunities for Mr create to work with this new entity. To work on my we county's health care needs as a county so. I'm offering that as another way to address requests from. Mr Carroll. What over your budget the only two things with your mark for me that I was going to bring up. But I wanted to but this was what was a. Look at this really close to have been following for quite some time. This is one that we need to because. You cannot be full. Would be rude. To possibly could to avoid. To. Reduce support because it would be really for some people. I think you missed it there any other comments discussion. Clear what. Fifty but they need to match it you know I'm asking that looking more at two hundred thousand and their work to match it because then they'll get more than the two fifty but it shows that the company is committed to giving them a portion of it and that should try to convince some of the outside foundations and potential donors that the company is showing a level of. I would call a significant amount of French resources to assist them. Dealing with their unique situation. So that's what I'm asking you to consider. Thank you for your. Type. Come up front with their two that's. Come up with a match in front and then you go and try to replace their whatever fund they have currently under their jurisdiction in control they can approach it that way and then they get access to the full two hundred thousand immediately. If we agree on this matching component. Portions and then if they say well we got one hundred thousand right now so we'll take half of the money at this time and then we'll fund you know. The foundations of what not that this is how we're doing it and potentially can get either the decision of monies or S. The new. Public partnership for the hospital system is another way to help US is funding since I know Mr Creagh is sort of started conversations to this might at least show the new partnership of the system that the county has shown his commitment by participating in providing at least two hundred thousand dollars worth of support. OK thank you for your explanation. Anything else member this is based on. Mr Craig if you can't handle this I don't want us to. Think that's fine misplaced He said he would take. The minutes yet so Mr Creagh if you can give us a response if you would care to give us a response regarding my. Proposal you know let me see if it is two hundred thousand and ask you to match it for the from the moments Well I think that's a fair offer I just have to let you know that we have to basically incur this on an ongoing basis but. We do have a we have a foundation that we can ask to to match the tomb So you're suggesting two hundred thousand and we pay about three fifty so it would seem that you just match the match is two hundred thousand dollars we need to put up two hundred thousand and that you would match dollar for dollar from the foundation of donors two hundred thousand OK but we will show them that we're willing to give you half this two hundred thousand in the budget as a commitment I think that's a very creative solution is that something you can live with because I'm happy to support that you know I think so I think we should. Spend a very educational two days for me. And I understand where the chair is coming from and being I think this is a partnership is what we should be aiming for and appreciate your offer. Because I think you know I have no power asking with expertise said You're doing your part in matching the taxpayers apart to provide you with the two hundred thousand. One I thank you for your. Attitude toward this as a partnership and that's why the chair has seen that I'm happy to support this two hundred thousand if you can be willing to work it is a partnership and match the two hundred thousand. So that's something we can yes thank you for that is to thank you chair. We have constant members and this will move this forward with the. Requirement that it be matched dollar for the holiday mcu and then also. Place it in the committee report so that it is very clearly stated that this was a one time requests to this body. Let's move to file for fifty five kind of how we have billet patient center. The chair has to leave in the requests of this new request so five hundred thousand dollars. Just is there we'll pose as Mr Carroll thank you Chief. We've submitted. She really cheap. To put it. Thank you I appreciate you being creative in looking for funds and I say I would say this would definitely qualify for those federal dollars if we can get it move for Mr COUCH That's all well and good but if it doesn't past CD for whatever reason then they're out they're out. For this budget year for this budget year is if that's OK with Mr Carroll I'm fine with that and that's why Mr Kerry the situation OK Thank you. I think that Mr Carroll. It is due diligence and the church takes in for that and that so I was able to make this comment to the committee this evening so we have consensus. A Thank you and that's a good line for fifty nine. Mr white like the one health center also received I think five hundred thousand dollars from the state legislature at least that's in the pipe. Thank you. Heritage. The reduction was based on how we. Treat other. Co-chair requests in the pass some organizations asked for a zero and build their facilities asked for fifty percent support their facilities . So the reduction that you see from the chair is. Up to over one point. Two million dollars total appropriations for this project. So I compared it to being out the need and other cultural projects that we have supported. And so my recommendation I'm giving you is two fifty but the chair is open to propose to the committee. Mr victory you know and. I don't know how much he got them you know how much a day yet if you apples without. It you might have made it work she. Will get that because we went from the year that we give the money we added the. What we. Recognize inflation inflation adjustments to the current dollars And so the chair made his comparison. For this requests. You know well she was looking down off. The three hundred fifty well last year he asked for the one point three And do we gave him seven hundred or seven hundred fifty fifty with the idea that the difference. And there's been as you have heard and testimony from the group. There was a whole mass of change that was required by county. Fire hydrants and some other things that they never counted on that at the last moment they were required to do like everything else you know. So. That's why I wanted to strengthen fifty dollars and I was going to take it out of the emergency fund like restructuring and I notice a big money sitting somewhere and not within general funds and this would complete what they need they also get money from the state hopefully because it was approved but like everything else you never know with the state that's another challenge with the state and the you know there's another something else that I'm going to bring up that I'm not going to be happy with but again it came down today the state has cut some some major funding to another and I'll explain that later I want to go there now I was told that by mistake when we got home but she's not sure when and if. The government is going you know the governor's office that works. So this will ensure that they can compete their project. Complete what I call. To it an issue these working together not just want but to have been vital when she was a student this community into the stadium for years and years and years. And being and I'm being pious right now I have. Let me see myself one of the few put to use last few admission he and. We're becoming more real quick. But it's not the point the point is preserving our heritage all what we contributed to these Islands Puerto Ricans and the Portuguese cultures have been a great great asset to this community to the Zionists and so I would hope my members would support that because I really really like to get this done. And know more after. We get it we're done so that's my request. And that's the one I've been waiting for all night that's it. That's all that's all of us is. Able to report to the committee at the same. Chair We need a few more minutes he's. Fire . Mandated things that sorted through the monkey wrenches into their cost Yes I just said I'm. Mr victory know who know more about the specifics of the project to respond by saying yes. We have it. Thank you Mr Chair. Because you believe in a review of past budgets show that received three hundred twenty five thousand dollars in F Y two thousand and five. The niece a veteran center received eight hundred thousand. From fiscal years ninety eight and two thousand and seven and heritage Hall had received. One point five million in F Y twenty thirteen and. Seven hundred and fifty thousand in this year's budget Yes correct thank you so that's two point two five million to the roof already appropriated and you heard. Comments from myspace and Mr Victorian know why some of this change orders occurred so Mr Victorian he's asking to reinstate the reduction from the church's proposal of three hundred fifty thousand. To put this back to. The projects so the project for as far as from the county standpoint he's going to be two point eight five million dollars. You know I'd. Like to see this project go but. You're. On your idea of requesting a match I would be comfortable with doing. Doing four hundred thousand with a one to two match so they could get to their six hundred if they if they matched our four with their two or if. You think that's too much of a stretch. Of five for one match we give them five they come up with one. Mr victory you know. The five to one match that I can handle that I can handle. That John and I think I think we can take that challenge if so can we. Assume that you know misplaced. Or is so I feel that I would ask misplaced for thoughts. All I know is it's a lot. I don't begrudge ready to buy. In for their customers. You know. This group very seriously does a great deal of fund raising and a lot of the fund raising that they do they do it for scholarships because I know that every year to give scholarships to to students that are going to college and it's a very small. Raising and a very good job so. I would want to get a commitment from the organisation match but it sounds like a very. Good proposal I mean it's fair but you know I wouldn't want to commit on their behalf because I don't really know I'm not a member. So this is what I would ask committee to do this morning. Morning I am going to. Vote for this chair in the running through my brain is the issue. Of additional cash so. I appreciate the comments of all of the members I would say the chair would recommend this committee consider. A lot of money but. I would recommend the five to one match we'll put up five hundred thousand and asked to be match with five dollars of ours to one dollars of theirs to make up the total six hundred thousand they come up with a hundred that will put up five hundred of them and then bring our total to two point seven five million dollars contract we have consensus consensus will put that in and the language for the matching. Yes ma'am is this for open space fun under cultural. Or are you prepared to give the Canadian response to Mr. Cochran's question. I'm checking your step go on to the next one I'll take a look at the code. Sure we use every so. Let's see. Just what changes to whom this program to. Visit. And we'll be. Concerned. We. Need some time we have. Mr I think I have written down that for seventy one William a llama somebody wanted to increase but I don't know what's. Right miss. Miss but. Yes. I had. Had. Had an additional requests it's not in here during the testimony pushing. For more money and there's anybody remember what that was. Isn't it thirty thousand. Stuff in can we check. Mr White with staff what the increase of who have a lot of us last year we can say there was a. I recall somewhere there out of forty or forty five thousand in Greece last year . Thank you. Mr. Thank you I'm going back to the. Open space fund for the. Heritage hall project I wouldn't recommend that one of our purposes says preservation of his store or culturally important land areas. It is a cultural building but it's not necessarily a stereo Thank you. Could. Hold on members and every time we are going to maintain decorum just. Recognition to the chair first display so I thank you very much there. You know unfortunately I am history. I was born and raised in by you and I'm very familiar with the culture of this area. The area that they are planning to build this hall was where the people of the plantation including my parents attended. Events just like people go to me we used to go to that area and that was where all of the. Dances were held and all of the events like we have now I had been in and on and at the community centers it was held there that is the history of that area so if you want to preserve history that's what it is so I don't know you could stretch it I do realize it is a stretch what I would really you know well was talking about the open space but I was thinking of economic development because you know once this thing is built it will be a tourist attraction people will go there to look at the museum and to look at the of it and to look at the memorabilia that is going to be put there so it does become I think even economic development if you really want to get creative. Million dollar fund we have. Miss Cochran I think it's here I just want to thank. Her for looking that up I just you know cultural resource and perhaps I mean it's a stretch we're trying to find many creative ways here chair so I just thank you for no thank you for that question I thought it was very. You know I think it sure has a nice chunk in that area so I thought you know thank you Mr victory you know. We're going to agree and I remember my grandparents take you mean. That was historical But you know again the definition of historical it's kind of again if you. What is the science a historical. I mean. You know we've got to go and we've got to. Thank you so you know. Because you know we already moved forward five hundred thousand with the match. And by the community said Greenman we're going to redo have a reduction in the emergency fund. That was the committee's decision. So that's how we're going to. This project. The time to need regarding the. When the president is a. Yes. Mr White there was a sixty five thousand dollar increase last year over the previous year and so that's an increase of about thirty one percent and I'm like I can't support further increase this year. Thank you you know the comments. Did anybody make a. Good argument of all this so we were waiting for a. Response on how much should we give on the previous year's. Consensus consensus so we have a consensus consensus OK Thank you. Yes Mr Cochran. Already OK. Seven number for sixty two. That. Visit requests by Mr college. I mean I think we said consensus separately that we don't consensus on that yet it was a loose consensus but it's been seen. Since. For seventy five. Is there any. For the committee. There was a new one you know. Families who are. Sure. See. If you can assist the committee please when they give us a chair Yes this is a new request. At five fifteen did not receive funds however they did receive funds in F Y fourteen thank you you know what were the what was the front of us there it was sort of they received two hundred thousand dollars in F Y fourteen or just. There was a. Deal there sort of the assistance for their They're standing. By the building paper. And in the chair me the reduction. Over this one for this year. Mr MOLINA I think it was a chair it was an approximate. Of half or a little a little more than half to yeah forty seven dollar reduction to thirty five thousand thank you. For the chair. Contents are you but my community health center. Yes I understand. What I understand what I'm asking people to piece I am going to see we have consensus on the recommendation consensus insist. It's a new requests thirty thousand chairs proposal is deletion of the requests is there any proposals for the committee Mr Big to Reno and of course the notice would fall in that area and then I support this group and would be doing all this so if you're if the committee would feel I would I would ask for fifteen. And. That's all I mean and I have a general fund but fifty thousand just to make sure that they have something to help them get going with this new facility to trying to build that was then moving from. They've been asked to leave and they need some help so I think fifteen is you know I would hope would at least help them get started maybe we'll see what happens to you for the requests for Mr Reno and any further discussion Mr wait do we. Get funds from other I am not sure if we have information on that. He said he's going to need to review that you have any comments you can share that have to check on any of the parts but from my understanding no that we've not funded them ever before or not in the recent history before and I don't I don't recall them getting funding either. If I recall correctly it was last year the year before they came to help with some money to. Build their stage area in the theater yeah yeah yeah I forget what it was that's not happening yeah that's our facility no no but I don't know I don't know if they had a request that production and they wanted the improvements on the stage area yeah they did come down remember that but I forget what if we gave them anything or I think we did because it was our property and our facility Yeah but a bit but I know they asked you know yeah this is something that the county record it and. Has their hand up. Or ministration Yeah. I forget what it was yeah I'm sorry OK OK members so the proposals. Fifteen. Thousand at this time. I'm going to have. I'm OK with Mr Victoria's proposal Yeah. Thank you. Let's move down to the line for ninety five I don't last say Hispano Is there any proposals for that committee. We. Are going the current year's funding of ninety five thousand five fifty. At a cherry just to reduce the increase of four thousand four hundred fifty dollars. So do we have consensus I don't think that's I think you shall move forward if you so much under economic opportunity for senior playing Coordination Council according Nader. I would recommend that we support the request of eighty thousand dollars to have consensus. Yes Mr I believe they came and said that they needed three thousand more to go to either Molokai or law and I. Thought this line. Yeah was. OK. So the request came after the middle yes. OK. Well you came from a couple. So I'd like to add that three thousand. It's one of the I can't remember what I learned that she said it was but. You know. I don't really understand because this is for the position of the coordinator. This is the position Yeah this is not operations zero point to support a position so. Let's say that your is very happy with. To support the request of. Mr Abbas you have anything else you could and thank you Mr Chair I think the funding supports the position and some of her operational costs and. Yet the request came in after the mayor's proposed budget came out but. The organization does have senior clubs on. It and would like to service them as frequently as possible so that's why the additional request would be needed. And I understand. So Mr Coach does your proposal. Is there any further comment. The chair won't support. So we're going to ask Mr Carroll do you support increasing this eighty thousand to eighty three thousand . Based. Cochrane. Mr Coach bicycle Yes Mr White No Mr victory no. This moves forward for supporting it so it will lead. To eighty three thousand. Dollars for family support services lane for three and seeing the proposals before the committee consensus. We are consensus. Move forward. By we Youth and Family Services and your requests is there any proposals for the committee misplaced thank you very much chair this one hundred thousand dollars was requested by health minister judge him one hundred thousand dollars because they're trying to. Their facility and they need this money . So this is for construction or design or play any money would you know miss Mr Million if you can see how to get me a. Thing As A chair of the budget details indicate this is a one time appropriation for planning and design. Does this mean the coming back for construction. Chair miss this year or Mr Cunningham also indicated it was a two hundred thousand dollar. Cutting in design process and he was also seeking C.D.G. Funds. So . That was going to be made. Me. Just basically is recommending a restoration. The church doesn't support it so we're going to need to Mr White. If this is for design money I would prefer that they. Apply and I know that my recollection was they were going to proceed with an application to see B.G. Thank you for that. Yes Yes Thank you Mr Cochran Mr Coach misfit. No it's a victory and I. Chair would snow at this stuff not move forward with the need to affirmative So this request is denied. Yes Mr experience for me from basic press. And I can. I am going to try and finish justice grants portion and then recess. Just just so that you know I know that we will not finish. This. I'm going to ask you to. Thank you again how you manage your memory. And making some progress. You can see but I see it making me do it you know getting the job. That we could get. I mean. We had. You know what we considered a. Key because I know you all have some plans for a portion of tomorrow. So playing five twenty three mental health. No we have our for somebody that you know. How is this. And mental health two different different organizations about. Anything else. Provides advocacy for persons with mental illnesses and gets them according to a different agencies. Is an agency and they're requesting money for a psycho social rehabilitation. Program for homeless. And only because that's one of the. Thank you for that agreed. We don't have consensus misplaced. Twenty three member health. Or the fifty thousand or no. Sorry. Yes or yes. OK. This would have to be general fund. Discussions. In the car for a car. OK. Well yeah yeah. Just so you know. And I will and I'm not I'm going to avoid the. Choices made by the members at this time said Just so you know. Mental health was giving sixty five thousand. In. Two thousand and fourteen. Two thousand current yet they have currently sixty five thousand under homeless outreach for mental health as well as in two thousand and fourteen. Two thousand and fifteen they have a thirty thousand dollar appropriation for the psychosocial rehab program. Current year and they have expanded nothing as of the year to date thank you for that. They're doing me. It's good to have that kind of background. Reverse my. She reversed there is no proposal before the committee. Or. Lane five twenty seven Roman Catholic Church ninety thousand already fought enough. So this is a revisit Let's move on a chair and I wouldn't I would agree to a lower amount on this but Mr White I'm sorry. I would like to propose thirty thousand dollars. Mr weight. Thank you but. Yes I reverse psychology. Whatever I want no I don't let me save money on the small vote little. Thank you thank you. Thank you. If. You've got energy after that comment. Mr White is recommending thirty thousand dollars for this is spice the support the requests. Is Cochran I miss a coach no. Yes. Mr Goodman. Mr Vick. Is most accord with support from six so this will be restored thirty thousand dollars. So ration army line five thirty one consensus at census consensus Thank you. Mr yes Mr victory no no you don't get mad at me but I took it on five three eight. Three eight yes we had reached a consensus on the services will fail in the yes and I did and I just sent out an email to all of you because I received the e-mail because I was in Honolulu today and. State informed are what your name. Debra Stone Yeah yeah that's that lady on Aging for economy yeah yeah thank you for that they were taking one point four million dollars from the elderly program which is what they use a lot in this area. They're cutting across the board and one point two million. From another program which Maui's portion would be nearly five hundred thousand dollars and that's a direct. Impact on our field and elderly. You know. We can I make up every dollar every time the state leaves my suggestion which is. To add another two hundred thousand to at least help offset some of that loss now it's up to you guys but I sent the e-mail and I hope all of you got it if you didn't I apologize so I'm putting out there you know it's our seniors that are going to be directly impacted Now she also told me that they have a way to go down to help who have the true need the target they're targeting. Not for the very wealthy the wealthy. Those who cannot and these are many of our seniors from my plantation. Experience in dire need so that's my requests for an expenditure two hundred thousand I'd like to make up all the whole five hundred thousand but we can not everything I just felt a little is better than nothing at all but it's up to them but I will tell you that it was very disappointing and if some other things will be coming down the pipe that the state is becoming a government I don't want to see that as Mr be going to the states. Right behind Mr Chair short recess pleaders coach. Recess. Let's get back to work we steam moonlight. We view the current expenditures for the fill in I would really undo the human concerns program I can tell you this is as of March thirty first. They've actually spent. Let's see what he did it would give them a brighter incumbrance of what one hundred eighteen thousand. We gave them in the current year six hundred sixty one thousand seven thirty nine. If expense four hundred eighty six thousand India bring comfort two hundred seventy five thousand I don't know what that they come and says so the remaining balance is two point seven percent or seventeen thousand seven hundred dollars bit annoying the incumbrance. Seems to carry over incumbrances year to year year because the forward from last year and a hundred in about eighteen thousand dollars of income Francis into the current for use. And not hoping to not doing what salted away says he's doing Mr. Mr Buzz thank you Mr Chairman since these are grants they hold ten percent. Least ten percent at the end of the year for the final payment so they get all the quarterly reports in and everything like that and that two hundred thousand dollars or so that you have in there is the probably the third quarter. To fourth quarter payment minus that ten percent. Thank you for that explanation Mr Bush that's why we hear you working with us delete. OK you've heard Mr. Again disses something just secret in the lead so the chair is open to this consideration. For the unless it meets that this kind of. Miss. Will not go back to any consensus items or will never get done. Yet so this is a unique situation a ledge again. That's going to try and kick the can. So this is County regarding their responsibilities as I understand what I participated in the current constitution language. My disappointment with their address of their responsibilities in this area that the Constitution to me is quite clear who has been given that authority and responsibility. As to why did you have anything you want to but yet something you wanted to see I know I'm just you know I feel the same way you do it's really disappointing that the state seems to have no problem cutting back the services that they know everyone is depending on and. They. Won't give us any increase in the th T. Which I've always felt as more of a simple tax than a state tax that's just it's just disappointing all the way around and I don't know that there are seem to get held accountable for. What. Mr victory is asking for two hundred thousand dollars more. For this program and I understand his comments. Very much but. As you chaired that is looking at. Probably going to pay for things I won't be supporting it so but I will leave you to the members misplaced thank you very much to your chair could we asked Mr Buzz if you can give us a little more information about what we spend this money on think you miss a buzz. Thank you Mr Chair So what it looks like from. Ms Stone walls information that you provided. The care services and. Are what was cut not sure the amounts of each Those are grant revenue they receive to fund staff and also assistance to. Organizations that provide. Care services like personal care and services. So those cuts would be in that area. This is a. Yes a correct place to place any additional general fund amounts that you like because this. Service is to the fairly early existence because of previous federal cuts. From many years ago the county took over. And we continue to carry those extra costs to benefit the seniors in our community their frail I think it's important that we understand what these care is all about care is for seniors who are still in their homes and trying to remain independent and we provide through that through. Her office grants for people to go in and do like choice to this which might mean that they go in and help them do their laundry and their cooking and cleaning and help them take a bath you know these things because if we don't they become institutionalized and then Mr Craig and it cost us even more so. It's a very difficult situation and I certainly understand why the county shouldn't have this burden but you know these are our seniors and so we continue to try to help them but I agree with your frustration it's really not fair but. I don't know how we change it it's hard. One we've worked hard for he says in a. I guess at times and view for natural situation by our peers but I believe because we made hard choices and. They can be in the same position by making the same hard choices that. Unfortunately for many of the elect they prefer to be popular than right. I think the council is shown many times they burst first to be right and popular on important issues and key votes so on just again commend you on being true to. Your beliefs and that you know for same being right is not popular either most of the times but most of the same spot police not the right decision either so I understand your frustration. It's more than frustration that's in me right now. But I understand it is our own people. So we are in that knife that when one is recovering we're going to support it but it's also killing us because of what that space you have to pay for this. But I would say I commend all of you that your understands and part of my commitment that I will not turn our backs on our own people thank you thank you. So we shall find a way to make this framed it to pay for this if it's accepted so do we have consensus against it just. The chew with this. Let's the paper. Mr Just to be clear the. Committee's recommendation is to add two hundred thousand dollars to the grants to services the frail elderly in general. Does it specifically because there was two areas program areas that were cut. And you made the proposal so. To put a character yes a computer guest services not the other site OK thank you so is that there is of the cut. Could take up to sites yes what he's asking should be placed for the. Not just the one on one. Is that clear to the members. Or to the staff proviso that OK Thank you. OK. Moving right along. Jane get. Five forty three members Special Olympics away if we recommended a small reduction to go back to the twenty fifteen level. There is a proviso that is being proposed that provides ten thousand three hundred dollars for a model. Is there any other proposals for the committee victory no . Special Olympics any special at least on the island of the night I guess. And I just thought about it. I would see. Young people or young adults that need help one of the areas that has been successful is in the Best Buddies program. And some of our alumni residents were able to vote and participate through the Best Buddies program so. I haven't had any requests to regarding this Special Olympics venue for lunch that I would be happy to advocate for if was brought forward but. That's my take I'm open with the best buddies Thank you. Any proposal before the committee and that is consensus let's move forward. University of Hawaii we call it copper corporate education program I am working we need a reduction in half. And as a shared with the new person this is not part of the seat to our request that is a separate requests but on this call operative education requests consensus we have consensus on this thank you women helping women I'm asking you to consider two thousand and fifteen funding it do we have consensus that. You have just. Moralistic spent their last year or so and asked Mr Barr if he has the ability to respond to your question this group. Give me a second to fifteen some I'm running a little slower and I only ask because. It's like real the domestic violence that goes on in our communities. I mean disappearance. Right. Mr Mr Caruthers Mr Baez's looking up as well I believe. They also were looking for helping out. And Hanukah Iran Honna Yes I've heard that around us so. I don't know I think I would support. Restoring the reduction yet Mr Chair Yes Mr Boss So. The. Grant of two hundred two hundred thousand dollar and eight hundred fifty dollars was. Actual expenditures was. Two hundred thousand two hundred sixty five dollars and they had a one thousand dollar incumbents in a prior year so they have about that ten percent twenty thousand dollars left over so it looks like they are fully expend Yeah. Thanks for that report. He's considered the starting. Key thank you for that. Many of the comments members so I know this was part of what we heard in the heart of district meeting. The chair was there the chair heard the census and consensus. This is five five two kero this is about restoring ten thousand dollars to women helping women and part of the expansion requests is to provide services in a smile we. Would like to pose with all those people. Yes. OK so let's just say the request before the committee is restored in ten thousand and they provide that for you smile we just don't have consensus. Mr Molina just to clarify is that proviso that ten thousand dollars is all right thank you yes correct yeah the chair will support this I don't support scumbags. Getting abuse. Can you tell us what you really think it. Was. A coalition for a drug free tonight the. Consensus of consensus. Is there in your requests is there any proposals for the committee that they want to Molokai. I believe Mr Boss he says yes yes this is and there they were I believe they were also. Domestic violence shelters. Substance of substance sorry and I think that. Maybe wrong but I members. She said that. The executive director had expressed that she was bringing in money from the ranch maybe fifty thousand. I think this is OK. And thank you for your comments Mr Carville do we have consensus members intensity . Thank you. So much let's move on. With. This but these. This body I five ninety. Three hundred forty eight because this is. Going to help your island it helps my county we've seen a real positive. Feedback or call aberration with students and you know really that mutual respect. That has been around for many many years has really been taking care of. Really where I can see the positive recent effect so I'd like that we sort of what a three hundred forty dollars please thank you very much and you for the comments. We don't have consensus is that Carol. Thank you Miss. Thank you Mr Cochran. Thank you Mr Coach thank you Mr Carville Yes. Mr Goodman. It's a victory in no way. This moves forward with supporting. Lane five ninety four Big Brothers Big Sisters of my we in the proposals before the committee you know Mr Chair. I'm I'm very supportive of youth services however these folks have seen this and haven't come in and asked to have a restored so I I would I would say consensus of consensus and sense of thank you let's move forward. Boys and Girls Club but. Yes Mr Cochran Yeah. No OK. We are on five ninety seven members club Mr shift for the record I am a board member of the Boys and Girls Club so I cannot vote but I can advocate. And I would certainly request one of the members to restore this reduction that we store forty seven forty four hundred eighty two I thought if I want to thank you Mr victory no and Mr Coach thank you for the disclosure Thank you. You know if we're so responsible I thank you for full disclosure. Mr Victor Reno is proposing a restoration of forty seven thousand four hundred any further discussion members. Is to Carol support restoration of forty seven thousand four hundred four boys and girls club. Thank you Mr Mr Cochran Mr coach. Saying thank you yes you're excused thank you miss Mr White. Mr Goodman. Mr yes victory you know is most worried with seven supporting it thank you members . Line six two Boys and Girls Club of my we for you success center we. Know somebody had to revisit. Syria. For the committee not. Just let's move forward let's find. Out let's see how I mean come on the plane six one zero I reduced it by her walking three hundred twenty eight dollars. Six twenty six week anomic opportunity is steering the proposal for the committee misc. Repress restoration we've had are you get. Different this is that having to support and share some of. Their appreciation for. What they're receiving this program. Thank you for the requests from misquote. Him ice or I understand but there's no consensus as to Carol thank you misplaced I miss Cochran Mr Coach I miss Covello Yes Mr White. And Mr victory and. It would seven so already in this. That money. Six thirty. This is a net because we transferred substance abuse to anyone and combined it with this program I made a slate in your original reflection on the original requests from the twenty four thousand so with just minutes including the substance abuse comes to forty two thousand and six. Is there any proposal for the committee we have consensus consensus. Project Graduation is a proposal for the committee. I put on hold on just a victory no give the floor OK I don't know if the masses. I'm comfortable with this with. The proviso that it would have and every high school would have an opportunity to. You know you don't. See any particular high school so I'm assuming that if you look at. Everybody I mean right yes the current practice is. Broken into equal. High schools that every high school has the same opportunity to ask for the same All right folks OK if that's the case then on top of. All the schools and high schools in this county have the same opportunity to get their. Percentage. Because they'll get the same amount OK doesn't matter says a school we just said as a school as a school yes Mr Mr Copas that include charter schools. I'm not too sure. Maybe he was some comment. But you know actually Mr chances when I don't know I believe. If you're thinking about the key I am it's a public charter school and I don't think there'd be any restriction you know so yes we're getting we're getting confirmation from the audience that yes it is included thank you chair and they do spend. Pretty much all their money so yeah the schools just have to request to receive the money but it is for every school to have equal opportunity. We do we have consensus that's just. Thank you. Doesn't have time to be turned into pumpkins I was hoping that as soon as I'm finished this part meant. To write to you did he say. Anything yet. You know it would because we're going to going to deal with animal management in Iowa this is the last one for at this point in time that's my youth center facility playing six five one. That we already have. Done so we are done for this portion of the budget. So just as you know where we are. At this point in time we should have been finished with the whole review including c.a.p rates and fees you know that we have not done we have not done rates and fees and we have not finished the departments from alphabetical of liquor control to water department. So we are going to be in recess my suggestion to you is that we turn at ten thirty. But wow. And so please be prepared for no more than a thirty minute lunch and we have. Big brunch. And you can bring it here and then the chair is going to look at the. Internal deadline and at three P.M. And see where we are. I prefer that if we have to do the three P.M. Recess so you can plan. I prefer not to bring you back tomorrow evening. Because there's things that we all want to do I want you to get the rest I want the staff to get the rest but I will bring you back Sunday. At the reasonable time because I know there's so many of you that have church requirements or other family requirements. You know we're going to need to finish hopefully we'll finish it Sunday sometime Sunday is my plan for the committee I want you to know that at this point in time. We are going to need to look at train being how we going to increase rates and taxes because at this point in time we've already put back another two point two one four million in general fun. We've had it another additional seventy seven thousand for specific sewer freeze. Solid Waste Management we're going to need to find and then eight hundred fifteen thousand dollars through the rates. And the only thing that we have reduced right from the current adjustments is the highway fund. Thirty five thousand dollars Well that is still something there we already know we've committed to place in another part yes. So we're just hearing us granny instead is that this thing you're going to need to maybe move up tax increases from five and a half to maybe six and a half seven percent coverage just where we at. Us where we at. Seven percent but then true increase in property taxes OK so we should be in recess until ten thirty this morning. With with the.
