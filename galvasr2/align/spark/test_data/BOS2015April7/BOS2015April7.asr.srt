Legend. Of the United States of America
and the Republic with stands one

20
00:01:29,82 --> 00:01:34,19
nation under God indivisible
with liberty just all.

21
00:01:38,56 --> 00:01:42,32
Right. This is opening doors with

22
00:01:42,85 --> 00:01:49,35
a new member we have another packet
of the names or individuals who have

23
00:01:49,39 --> 00:01:55,15
requested consideration so I'm going to
enter these four names into the right.

24
00:01:57,49 --> 00:02:02,10
Of the chairman I would like to make note
that at this time I'll have to recuse

25
00:02:02,11 --> 00:02:07,78
myself from this discussion both because
one of the candidates is my campaign

26
00:02:07,79 --> 00:02:10,24
manager for reelection against me.

27
00:02:19,55 --> 00:02:24,91
So I'll read the four names and then ask
each one of those to their nominating.

28
00:02:27,77 --> 00:02:34,74
Positions alternate. To the
Zoning Board deals. So the

29
00:02:34,74 --> 00:02:41,63
names that we considered
were. Like I'm. Very

30
00:02:41,97 --> 00:02:47,37
sorry that better yet OK. OK so the four

31
00:02:48,23 --> 00:02:54,81
individuals who come forward. Include
Dave Brown. Seventy American way

32
00:02:55,95 --> 00:03:02,25
Kevin Powers forty four
Prospect Street Ari Weinstein

33
00:03:02,65 --> 00:03:09,34
Weinstein one twelve South High
Street and Kurt geisha and five

34
00:03:09,38 --> 00:03:10,37
Oakwood terrors.

35
00:03:17,29 --> 00:03:23,18
So. Each of us could just nominee
who we would like to see.

36
00:03:24,19 --> 00:03:29,49
Named as the alternate we can start it
with with an explanation to the discussion

37
00:03:29,50 --> 00:03:36,02
I'm. Going to first. Love the end
of the table that's where the.

38
00:03:38,61 --> 00:03:41,13
First five thank thank all for
candidates it was I thought it was

39
00:03:41,15 --> 00:03:45,10
a good discussion of the questions were
pretty straightforward and I actually

40
00:03:45,11 --> 00:03:50,49
enjoyed going back to Scotian type interview.
I think I'm partial to David Brock

41
00:03:50,49 --> 00:03:56,35
for that for the following reasons.
I like the fact that he's got

42
00:03:56,36 --> 00:03:57,83
a lot of institutional knowledge

43
00:03:57,87 --> 00:04:01,83
a lot of historic knowledge of the past
projects he's been very involved with the

44
00:04:01,84 --> 00:04:06,91
boards. With the zoning board in the
past obviously but the other boards and

45
00:04:06,92 --> 00:04:12,38
committees and processes that kind of
interact with the zoning board for instance

46
00:04:12,39 --> 00:04:15,36
the. The route one resign
he brought that to

47
00:04:15,37 --> 00:04:19,39
a certain level I think there's still
some work to do on that signed by

48
00:04:19,40 --> 00:04:25,90
a lot he's very very involved in that as
well as the. The new look codified in the

49
00:04:25,91 --> 00:04:32,42
new regulations. The fact that
he goes to the meetings and he's

50
00:04:32,56 --> 00:04:37,16
rejoining for no particular reason other
than he has some knowledge and wants to

51
00:04:37,17 --> 00:04:41,76
share it not to take away from any of the
other candidates but I think at this time

52
00:04:41,77 --> 00:04:43,52
we have one forty B.

53
00:04:43,91 --> 00:04:48,91
That has been submitted and he's got vast
knowledge on that plus you'll find out

54
00:04:48,92 --> 00:04:49,64
that more forty B.

55
00:04:49,65 --> 00:04:54,79
Is coming something that can jump in there
look at the numbers as well as the the

56
00:04:54,80 --> 00:04:56,68
past history I think it comes at

57
00:04:56,69 --> 00:05:03,28
a very good time and I think it fit in there
very well. Thank you know again it was

58
00:05:03,29 --> 00:05:09,22
a good process and thanks to every Kurt
Dave Kevin for throwing their hat in the

59
00:05:09,23 --> 00:05:10,86
ring and giving it

60
00:05:10,87 --> 00:05:16,06
a go. I struggled with this because I
was really torn because the saw the

61
00:05:16,07 --> 00:05:21,18
candidates. Their vision of the town and
how they would conduct themselves lines up

62
00:05:21,19 --> 00:05:25,70
very well with my vision. But at the end
of the day I'm going to go with the

63
00:05:25,71 --> 00:05:27,84
veteran Dave Brown
merely because he brings

64
00:05:27,85 --> 00:05:32,71
a long standing balance to
the position he's. He has

65
00:05:32,72 --> 00:05:38,19
a good reputation and in this particular
case with the issues that are coming

66
00:05:38,20 --> 00:05:42,27
before the town we know what we're going
to get so we're going to put my faith in.

67
00:05:43,89 --> 00:05:48,36
Thanks for. And I want to thank.

68
00:05:51,25 --> 00:05:57,17
Candidates that they came forward. And
I'm going to different different.

69
00:05:58,83 --> 00:06:02,94
I sort through the. Ideas

70
00:06:02,95 --> 00:06:09,63
a little different perspective being an
architect understanding where news is. You

71
00:06:09,64 --> 00:06:14,27
know how. To interact with land planning.

72
00:06:17,62 --> 00:06:24,49
Many. Things David. Came again
I also want to thank all

73
00:06:24,50 --> 00:06:29,90
four individuals who came forward as
potential candidates each one of you brought

74
00:06:30,50 --> 00:06:36,60
a very special skill set I think you
know representing the range of high tech

75
00:06:36,96 --> 00:06:40,07
community focus experience as

76
00:06:40,11 --> 00:06:47,11
a board member in the past and. Also
legal background so I think we were

77
00:06:47,12 --> 00:06:48,12
fortunate to have such

78
00:06:48,13 --> 00:06:54,41
a qualified group of individuals come
forward so thank you. I also selected Dave

79
00:06:54,42 --> 00:07:01,14
Brown as the alternate that I would that
I would support I think. Dave brings

80
00:07:01,15 --> 00:07:07,63
a wealth of experience to the to the Zoning
Board of Appeals and again I think at

81
00:07:07,64 --> 00:07:12,63
this time with the complexities of
what's going on with his E.P.A.

82
00:07:13,08 --> 00:07:14,87
His familiarity with the news

83
00:07:14,94 --> 00:07:21,61
a sign by law that brought me to. Lean
toward stated in this decision so

84
00:07:22,54 --> 00:07:27,69
again I just want to thank all four individuals
who came forward. So it looks like

85
00:07:27,70 --> 00:07:28,16
we have

86
00:07:28,64 --> 00:07:33,84
a three to one selection of David Brown as
our new alternate member for the Zoning

87
00:07:33,85 --> 00:07:37,94
Board of Appeals and we want to congratulate
David and again thank all the other

88
00:07:37,95 --> 00:07:39,17
individuals who came forward.

89
00:07:50,02 --> 00:07:55,10
To. Next time our
discussion on our agenda is

90
00:07:55,11 --> 00:07:57,42
a discussion followed by

91
00:07:57,43 --> 00:08:02,76
a vote for the fiscal year sixteen
operating Fetchit brandied Bill Feig and

92
00:08:02,77 --> 00:08:09,60
advisory committee. Are going to
present information. Good evening.

93
00:08:11,26 --> 00:08:17,46
I'm pleased to learn of present. Will and
I are about thirty percent of balanced

94
00:08:17,47 --> 00:08:24,09
budget tonight sixty five point
nine five million All in

95
00:08:24,81 --> 00:08:30,54
all the rise of. The
insurance accounts etc. It.

96
00:08:31,55 --> 00:08:32,70
Wasn't necessarily

97
00:08:32,71 --> 00:08:37,54
a cakewalk to get to the conclusion here
there were some tough decisions and you

98
00:08:37,55 --> 00:08:44,34
know. We also have had some challenges with
snow and ice as you would expect. We do

99
00:08:44,35 --> 00:08:44,71
plan

100
00:08:44,72 --> 00:08:50,02
a quarter million dollar contingency for
that. As an all out deficit that comes up

101
00:08:50,03 --> 00:08:55,58
the top of next year's taxes but we didn't
need an additional four million dollars

102
00:08:55,93 --> 00:09:01,34
in order to balance this year's snow and
ice deficit and working with the board of

103
00:09:01,35 --> 00:09:05,21
assessors they were. They released

104
00:09:05,55 --> 00:09:10,50
a quarter million dollars to the fund
that that deficit so we want to put in

105
00:09:10,51 --> 00:09:16,92
a position of either way. Having to put
further downward pressure on on budgets

106
00:09:17,74 --> 00:09:23,02
which would have impact of services would
be to something that the state is is

107
00:09:23,03 --> 00:09:29,50
allowing just this year and that is to
roll forward that deficit over three years

108
00:09:29,89 --> 00:09:33,78
which I certainly would recommend that given
that who knows what's going to happen

109
00:09:33,79 --> 00:09:37,96
next year and that happens again this isn't
just about the problem so we saw that

110
00:09:38,15 --> 00:09:45,00
the snow and ice issue. And the
of the school department was

111
00:09:45,01 --> 00:09:50,42
gracious enough they've apparently. Just
getting losing grant funding at this point

112
00:09:50,43 --> 00:09:56,25
in time for their kindergarten program
to the tune of about seventy seventy one

113
00:09:56,26 --> 00:09:58,98
seventy two thousand dollars
and that is that is

114
00:09:58,99 --> 00:10:05,06
a part of their revenue base to support
the program but they have agreed to you

115
00:10:05,07 --> 00:10:11,50
know absorb that within the accounts that
they have. The other accounts and general

116
00:10:11,51 --> 00:10:17,09
fund accounts if they have. It is not
something that terribly comfortable with but

117
00:10:17,10 --> 00:10:20,75
they understand that that's one of components
that we needed this year to to make

118
00:10:20,76 --> 00:10:27,74
everything balance the other big moving
item was health insurance. And although the

119
00:10:28,06 --> 00:10:33,05
the rate hasn't quite settled out yet it
looks like it's getting closer to being

120
00:10:33,06 --> 00:10:36,00
settled certainly sounds like the end of
the month and it sounds like it's going to

121
00:10:36,36 --> 00:10:41,73
settle very close to the number of the
premium increases that we're plan for which

122
00:10:41,74 --> 00:10:44,53
is seven and a half
percent and we did have

123
00:10:44,54 --> 00:10:51,23
a contingency for that just in case. As
far as the state proposal goes we only

124
00:10:51,24 --> 00:10:57,57
saw. The first first car turned over so
to speak out of the seven that you see in

125
00:10:57,58 --> 00:11:02,02
this process and that was the governor's
proposal. And given that we have

126
00:11:02,03 --> 00:11:05,60
a new governor in the proposal
wasn't announced until about

127
00:11:05,61 --> 00:11:10,79
a month ago and we will likely not see any
other information on this between now

128
00:11:10,80 --> 00:11:16,41
and when we got to put this
budget to bed. But in we had

129
00:11:16,42 --> 00:11:19,29
a meeting with the representative there
was today and he doesn't expect that much

130
00:11:19,30 --> 00:11:23,36
is going to change between now and then
Anyways at least on the key items that

131
00:11:23,37 --> 00:11:28,76
impact us which is the education and
the General Government aid so we feel

132
00:11:28,77 --> 00:11:33,21
comfortable with where we are using the
governor's number we've done that fast so

133
00:11:33,73 --> 00:11:39,92
with all that said and some trimming that
the town manager needed to do to budget

134
00:11:39,93 --> 00:11:44,51
requests we were able to come
in on balance and so we have

135
00:11:44,55 --> 00:11:50,02
a balanced budget that's consistent with
our. Range plan keeps us on track for some

136
00:11:50,03 --> 00:11:55,67
longer term objectives that we've talked
about before about some debt service that

137
00:11:56,30 --> 00:12:01,05
we will likely need to incorporate into the
general fund in fiscal seventeen really

138
00:12:01,12 --> 00:12:06,37
related to the next building project so all
in all it took to founts and some good

139
00:12:06,38 --> 00:12:12,00
shape and. I think you'll want to highlight
some of the key changes that we have.

140
00:12:13,74 --> 00:12:18,23
Right Thank you Randy Good evening everyone
and I just want to say up for me also I

141
00:12:18,24 --> 00:12:22,99
think Randy for the tireless number of hours
he put into the process in pulling the

142
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:27,11
numbers together and I have to tell
you that he made all of our lives

143
00:12:27,12 --> 00:12:30,95
a lot easier by doing the work that he did
and I really appreciate that that effort

144
00:12:31,01 --> 00:12:35,52
and also one thing the icon for all the
hours that they put into the process. Was

145
00:12:35,53 --> 00:12:36,51
relatively a smooth it was

146
00:12:36,52 --> 00:12:40,63
a relatively smooth process and I'm
appreciative of that and in everybody's efforts

147
00:12:40,64 --> 00:12:44,72
to to make that this my first budget
and to be balanced and without

148
00:12:44,97 --> 00:12:50,95
a whole lot of changes in concern so
there are some important items to be

149
00:12:50,99 --> 00:12:55,65
considered in the budget itself that we
didn't we were successful in getting in the

150
00:12:55,66 --> 00:13:00,00
centralized maintenance program first of
its kind here in the community something

151
00:13:00,01 --> 00:13:03,77
that we've been striving for for many many
years so we were able to support that

152
00:13:03,78 --> 00:13:09,72
and to indicate to include that in this
year's spending plan. I'm very very pleased

153
00:13:09,73 --> 00:13:12,61
to be able to do that because I think in
the in the long term it's going to pay us

154
00:13:12,62 --> 00:13:15,79
back to VNS in many many
ways and it also sets us on

155
00:13:15,80 --> 00:13:20,51
a track for for maintaining our most important
assets in the in the buildings that

156
00:13:20,52 --> 00:13:24,58
the buildings themselves. In the most
expensive ass as they should the most

157
00:13:24,59 --> 00:13:28,85
important is our people but having the
the buildings themselves be able to

158
00:13:28,86 --> 00:13:32,67
expensive assets we have to really take
care of them and this actually puts on

159
00:13:32,68 --> 00:13:37,49
a regular plan to do that. Secondarily
I was able to increase some hours in

160
00:13:37,50 --> 00:13:42,82
a couple departments and if some of the
personnel we want to add really new new

161
00:13:42,83 --> 00:13:46,61
bodies per se except when one exception
being in the fired upon we were that we had

162
00:13:46,62 --> 00:13:50,83
of the one captain position but that
position was being paid for with with

163
00:13:50,84 --> 00:13:56,93
ambulance receipts so it's not inside
the the levy put Levy Quezon So as

164
00:13:56,94 --> 00:14:01,46
a result of that action we were able to
increase the I was in the conservation

165
00:14:01,47 --> 00:14:03,71
office by two by some in

166
00:14:03,72 --> 00:14:08,42
a half hour to thirty five hours annually
I thought if I was weekly or out and then

167
00:14:08,74 --> 00:14:15,18
another three hours was added Tuesday to
the sanitariums inspection office in the

168
00:14:15,19 --> 00:14:17,95
office of the what health so we had

169
00:14:17,96 --> 00:14:21,95
a total of ten half hours to cross the
void Now having said that there were

170
00:14:21,96 --> 00:14:25,49
a number of difficult concept had to
make because I think everybody did

171
00:14:25,50 --> 00:14:29,65
a terrific job of advocating for their
positions and they made some excellent case

172
00:14:29,66 --> 00:14:35,73
as to why we should have added additional
positions but simply put we didn't have

173
00:14:35,74 --> 00:14:40,51
the numbers to support that so we'll continue
to keep those things on our radar any

174
00:14:40,52 --> 00:14:43,67
advantage we can support them later while
we certainly will go back and look at

175
00:14:43,68 --> 00:14:48,70
those things and in future years but for
this time I'm pleased to say that we are

176
00:14:48,71 --> 00:14:52,83
balanced and in a way looking
into why sixteen with a with

177
00:14:52,84 --> 00:14:59,62
a spending plan that that I hope we all
can live with so thank you. Just one

178
00:14:59,84 --> 00:15:06,65
question. Snow and ice deficit where it

179
00:15:06,66 --> 00:15:08,48
states that we could be eligible for

180
00:15:08,49 --> 00:15:14,31
a partial Fema reimbursement How much
does that mean I believe the numbers that

181
00:15:14,32 --> 00:15:20,11
I've heard through the fire chief. Works
putting all the details together make the

182
00:15:20,12 --> 00:15:25,03
submissions about one hundred seventy
thousand of something like that. The

183
00:15:25,04 --> 00:15:31,97
challenge with these Fema grants is that
if we do get done they almost always

184
00:15:31,98 --> 00:15:37,24
come too late to provide you know the relief
that we are before the end of this one

185
00:15:37,25 --> 00:15:44,14
year just this past fiscal year we
received money on to fema grants from two

186
00:15:44,15 --> 00:15:49,47
fiscal years prior so it's it ultimately
does come to the town and it flows into

187
00:15:49,48 --> 00:15:54,90
free cash and so it ultimately nets out
to where it would have Anyways it's just

188
00:15:54,91 --> 00:15:59,69
that it's it doesn't it doesn't allow us
to directly you know solve the problem you

189
00:15:59,70 --> 00:16:04,25
know with those dollars but we all try to
get at the interest group that we did one

190
00:16:04,26 --> 00:16:07,40
piece of good news that we can report
that we did receive some what is known as

191
00:16:07,41 --> 00:16:11,23
possible money from the state in the amount
of our ninety two thousand dollars that

192
00:16:11,24 --> 00:16:12,82
was distributed for of

193
00:16:12,83 --> 00:16:16,90
a total of thirty seven million that was
distributed state wide for cities and

194
00:16:16,91 --> 00:16:22,34
towns across the plan Wolf. And I was assured
by Governor Baker just over two weeks

195
00:16:22,35 --> 00:16:28,79
ago we've already Yes we are really approve
the of this we are the paperwork and we

196
00:16:28,80 --> 00:16:29,20
were hit with

197
00:16:29,21 --> 00:16:33,03
a one on the list so we were hopeful we'll
see that will be very very So we're here

198
00:16:33,04 --> 00:16:36,37
actually get out there is that we carry
some of the with the damage that was done

199
00:16:36,38 --> 00:16:41,93
to the roads it's what we would have
any other questions for you. Just

200
00:16:41,94 --> 00:16:42,93
a quick comment and

201
00:16:43,08 --> 00:16:49,05
a general question. Thank you again i'm
did this process looking at all the stuff

202
00:16:49,06 --> 00:16:53,41
that's in front of us started fourteen steps
ago back in the beginning of November

203
00:16:53,61 --> 00:16:57,68
and in the process with the department heads
but it's all it also kept popping out

204
00:16:58,25 --> 00:17:02,13
to the public whether it be the school
committee or board selectman or joint

205
00:17:02,14 --> 00:17:07,73
meetings advisory committees these are all
public processes in this five more steps

206
00:17:07,74 --> 00:17:12,08
to go to get to town meeting so that the I
think the process was very open pulling

207
00:17:12,09 --> 00:17:19,08
out. From the sheets that the overall
expected budget in the receipts receivable

208
00:17:19,09 --> 00:17:22,26
in two thousand and sixteen is
up by the head if you like for

209
00:17:22,27 --> 00:17:26,81
a half percent just generally without going
line by line right you know where is

210
00:17:26,82 --> 00:17:33,17
that coming from. It's coming from taxation
or merrily we you know we're able to

211
00:17:33,36 --> 00:17:38,56
you know grow the the levy limit you know
by two an ampersand There's also new

212
00:17:38,57 --> 00:17:42,68
growth that we've estimated between the
building commissioner in chief assessor and

213
00:17:42,69 --> 00:17:47,86
myself we've just news I think for five
hundred thirty five thousand new tax

214
00:17:47,87 --> 00:17:52,91
dollars for growth new growth in commercial
residential hot combined come by

215
00:17:52,92 --> 00:17:54,99
a combination of everything we have

216
00:17:55,00 --> 00:18:00,77
a grid that we review each year and we
we look back historically at like what's

217
00:18:00,78 --> 00:18:06,59
come in and. You know Bill's very good at
having the best intelligence on what is

218
00:18:06,60 --> 00:18:11,88
likely to pop in time to make it out to
work on to the tax rolls so last year the

219
00:18:11,89 --> 00:18:18,22
number we were estimated was over eight
hundred thousand and it came in just over

220
00:18:18,29 --> 00:18:22,59
over that about eight hundred thirty two
we've usually been very very close never

221
00:18:22,60 --> 00:18:28,11
been way off at least in you know my
tenure here so we feel good about you know

222
00:18:28,12 --> 00:18:31,90
this this number here five hundred thirty
five on the stage there really wasn't

223
00:18:31,91 --> 00:18:32,99
much of a of

224
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,25
a bump there most of it came from. Some
oddities with the charter school formula

225
00:18:38,60 --> 00:18:39,60
and I just don't have

226
00:18:39,61 --> 00:18:42,06
a lot of confidence in that this
point in time given that that's

227
00:18:42,07 --> 00:18:45,14
a moving target that there was think about

228
00:18:45,15 --> 00:18:52,09
a hundred seventy thousand or so from
that and then on the. On the other

229
00:18:52,38 --> 00:18:58,100
sources. Believe we added in net net about
three hundred thousand dollars from free

230
00:18:59,01 --> 00:19:05,93
cash and then as Bill alluded to with
regards to the new fire is ation has been

231
00:19:05,94 --> 00:19:10,97
supported it was approximately two hundred
thousand dollars of incremental emulous

232
00:19:10,98 --> 00:19:15,19
receipts dollars which are sustainable. You
know based on our current run rate that

233
00:19:15,20 --> 00:19:19,63
also came in to be the revenue equation
those are the primary items Thank you

234
00:19:19,67 --> 00:19:20,08
that's

235
00:19:20,09 --> 00:19:23,82
a done for sure thank you really what push
I think I have of yours you know what

236
00:19:23,83 --> 00:19:24,76
you see everything going up

237
00:19:24,77 --> 00:19:28,100
a little bit I know that you're is within
town where you have been able to realize

238
00:19:29,01 --> 00:19:32,58
efficiencies and cost savings
just could you highlight

239
00:19:32,59 --> 00:19:36,93
a few of those just to balance off the
increases I would sure this was one of the.

240
00:19:40,32 --> 00:19:45,51
Health insurance but it was generally
voted shows in general I believe. Are you

241
00:19:45,52 --> 00:19:49,27
talking about that yeah yeah I think with
that with the credits that have been

242
00:19:49,28 --> 00:19:55,32
received through the the the last control
program in essence some of those premiums

243
00:19:55,33 --> 00:20:01,94
have been able to be capped flat net
net. And. You know that there are.

244
00:20:03,15 --> 00:20:06,35
I think the other areas where we're
able to keep it but usually it's

245
00:20:06,36 --> 00:20:08,56
a lot of small budgets
you know there's not

246
00:20:08,57 --> 00:20:15,32
a lot of growth where you can prune away
at them. As far as you know efficiencies

247
00:20:15,33 --> 00:20:22,28
I believe that at the fire contracting of
itself I'm hopeful that that should put

248
00:20:22,29 --> 00:20:27,01
some downward pressure on overtime just
by the way that structured. And that's

249
00:20:27,39 --> 00:20:31,79
you'll see that in the first year you know
how much and when they would be able to

250
00:20:32,63 --> 00:20:38,36
build off of that. I'm not sure
there's anything else because it is

251
00:20:38,37 --> 00:20:43,28
a household insurance result insurance
to. That health insurance is now

252
00:20:43,29 --> 00:20:50,07
unfortunately heading in another direction
and. We've done so much to change the

253
00:20:50,30 --> 00:20:55,82
plan and you know redesign things to put
downward pressure on cost the boards made

254
00:20:55,83 --> 00:21:01,76
some important I mean important decision
to help with that. And so we've we've seen

255
00:21:01,77 --> 00:21:08,04
a downward trend in health insurance it's
because line in the budget and and now

256
00:21:08,05 --> 00:21:12,45
it's starting to go up again because now
we're starting to experience the natural

257
00:21:12,46 --> 00:21:17,93
trend medical cost inflation you know the
way everybody else is but I do believe

258
00:21:17,94 --> 00:21:21,31
that you know there's it's on the town
manager's radar it's if we look at this

259
00:21:21,65 --> 00:21:25,83
again and maybe and we look at you know
the next initiative to how we can try to

260
00:21:26,51 --> 00:21:30,96
you know stop the escalation in that budget
so some of the some of the pressures if

261
00:21:30,97 --> 00:21:31,49
I could just add

262
00:21:31,50 --> 00:21:35,26
a few points that's come across as that are
on health insurance are coming now from

263
00:21:35,27 --> 00:21:41,57
the federal government as well as the some
of the changes in plan design itself. We

264
00:21:41,84 --> 00:21:48,62
were seeing that the dish year the. State
general insurance commissions program

265
00:21:49,37 --> 00:21:53,28
has actually gone up rather dramatically
and they were there face to really look at

266
00:21:53,29 --> 00:21:57,47
redesigning their plan because because
the way the program so it's not it's all

267
00:21:57,48 --> 00:22:01,52
coming in with cost efficiencies there
so they're looking at with redoing their

268
00:22:01,53 --> 00:22:02,12
plan to

269
00:22:02,13 --> 00:22:07,41
a point where hopefully they'll it'll bring
the cost down. It's the the challenge

270
00:22:07,42 --> 00:22:12,02
we face particularly here in Massachusetts
is that we have some of the best health

271
00:22:12,03 --> 00:22:13,94
care in the world and so as

272
00:22:13,95 --> 00:22:20,49
a result it also plays into the cost of
that coverage for most of our employees so

273
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:23,10
we were really generally faced with

274
00:22:23,11 --> 00:22:27,44
a unique scenario many ways and here in
Massachusetts and this pilot in the with

275
00:22:27,45 --> 00:22:32,10
least the portion of the country because
we have there were many many teaching

276
00:22:32,11 --> 00:22:33,25
hospitals as well as

277
00:22:33,54 --> 00:22:36,35
a lot of research facilities here that
provide some of the best health care.

278
00:22:38,62 --> 00:22:43,46
Providers and services in the country in
the world for that matter so that plays

279
00:22:43,47 --> 00:22:49,38
into that equation but we are going to
continuously look at ways in which we can we

280
00:22:49,39 --> 00:22:53,04
can be efficient on that or that of
course in the whole whole equation we're

281
00:22:53,05 --> 00:22:59,41
looking at. I'm actually serving on the
on the the My avoid for the health the

282
00:22:59,42 --> 00:23:01,95
health trust so I'll be actually having

283
00:23:01,96 --> 00:23:06,02
a lot of say about actual some of the
redesign issues that were that are being

284
00:23:06,03 --> 00:23:10,04
discussed now in the new issue new
directions to looking at so will have direct

285
00:23:10,05 --> 00:23:15,10
input into some into some of those
discussions so let's put some of the other

286
00:23:15,16 --> 00:23:18,99
things that you've asked for was some
of things on the horizon actually quite

287
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:23,57
exciting in the sense that we were looking
at I know Roger Hill was is here tonight

288
00:23:23,58 --> 00:23:28,41
and you can talk about the the issue of
purchasing our street lights will be able

289
00:23:28,42 --> 00:23:32,19
to buy all our street lights we hope for
there in the in the next twelve months and

290
00:23:32,20 --> 00:23:36,03
then we can actually use those street
lights to our advantage by retooling those

291
00:23:36,04 --> 00:23:37,17
with the new L.E.D.

292
00:23:37,18 --> 00:23:42,37
Lights that will actually save us long
term costs over the next several years in

293
00:23:42,38 --> 00:23:46,14
addition to that will be able to retool
that the dash will heads of those lights

294
00:23:46,15 --> 00:23:51,71
with with technology that will help us to
to read by water meters more with that

295
00:23:51,72 --> 00:23:57,37
with with with wife i type of technology
so that there will again trip about the

296
00:23:57,38 --> 00:24:02,80
cost of getting that information second
there the third thing that I like to point

297
00:24:02,81 --> 00:24:09,75
out is that. By simply owning those lights
we also have the ability to look at that

298
00:24:09,81 --> 00:24:13,99
time my wife I capabilities which is something
that hasn't been discussed but it's

299
00:24:14,00 --> 00:24:17,38
something that certainly could be interesting
to look at over the next few years.

300
00:24:19,36 --> 00:24:24,22
We are continuously having discussions
right now about the trash program that we

301
00:24:24,23 --> 00:24:28,54
don't think that's going to change rather
significantly over the next year would

302
00:24:28,55 --> 00:24:32,96
have an active conversations with that with
the contractors on that piece hopefully

303
00:24:32,97 --> 00:24:36,96
I think we should be able to come to
resolution on that shortly and I'll be able to

304
00:24:36,97 --> 00:24:41,76
announce something to you both of you so
by the way WAY I am encouraged by the

305
00:24:41,77 --> 00:24:45,61
conversations I've had recently so please
do see the call in the right direction.

306
00:24:46,48 --> 00:24:52,93
So. The other item I would I would add
him. Is on the debt service side.

307
00:24:54,14 --> 00:24:58,60
As you know we haven't been adding adding
debt the last couple of years as we

308
00:24:58,61 --> 00:25:03,64
absorbed the debt from the last major
bill building projects this year the debt

309
00:25:03,65 --> 00:25:10,09
service is down about one hundred fifty
thousand excluded debt so that's obviously

310
00:25:10,10 --> 00:25:17,01
a direct sadness to the to the taxpayer
and as I I know you recall the intent of

311
00:25:17,02 --> 00:25:22,47
assuming that the town hall project goes
forward is that because of the savings

312
00:25:22,51 --> 00:25:28,78
that has been generated in in the budgets
over the last four years in terms of

313
00:25:28,84 --> 00:25:34,84
spending well within the limits of the of
the town's you know revenue capacity that

314
00:25:35,12 --> 00:25:41,36
we should be able to absorb the debt service
for the Tao within the general fund

315
00:25:41,37 --> 00:25:45,52
budget which means you know avoiding
a debt that exclusion that's been

316
00:25:45,53 --> 00:25:51,15
a long term goal and. We're on track for
that that was part of the the financial

317
00:25:51,16 --> 00:25:55,15
engineering to this year's budget to make
sure we stayed on plan that we maintain

318
00:25:55,16 --> 00:26:00,66
that bandwidth to to absorb that so I at
least say that we were still right on

319
00:26:00,67 --> 00:26:04,66
track and then the last piece that I think
that's really important to mention is

320
00:26:04,67 --> 00:26:07,89
a fact that we do think that this year we
should be able to come online with the

321
00:26:07,90 --> 00:26:10,93
new solar solar capabilities with

322
00:26:10,94 --> 00:26:16,25
a new solar farm which will go help to
reduce our energy costs on that and. When

323
00:26:16,26 --> 00:26:21,35
the time wired so that will pay for the
tricity cost so. There are some things some

324
00:26:21,36 --> 00:26:26,56
really good things on the forefront of
them we're going to continue to. Have

325
00:26:26,57 --> 00:26:31,25
discussions internally and externally about
how we can do do the job better we're

326
00:26:31,26 --> 00:26:36,02
still learning about the organization and
I think we've made some significant steps

327
00:26:36,03 --> 00:26:38,42
of the right direction
is very severe but still

328
00:26:38,43 --> 00:26:42,13
a lot more to come and I were really pleased
with the progress we've made that you

329
00:26:42,14 --> 00:26:49,07
think. You know first person long. Thank
you for putting this all together I

330
00:26:49,08 --> 00:26:49,39
know it's

331
00:26:49,40 --> 00:26:56,13
a huge undertaking and budget myself so. I
know what's involved I know the sacrifices

332
00:26:56,17 --> 00:27:01,94
a lot of the departments had to make. To
bring in the balanced budget one of my

333
00:27:01,95 --> 00:27:08,51
questions is obviously is what to do the
number on the roads. With with the meals

334
00:27:08,52 --> 00:27:12,41
tax receipts trying to get ahead

335
00:27:12,42 --> 00:27:16,98
a plan how was how can
that impact not only open.

336
00:27:18,93 --> 00:27:22,98
Obligation but these are
going to allow us to spend

337
00:27:22,99 --> 00:27:27,92
a little bit more on roads and in fixing
some of the some of the damages that that

338
00:27:27,93 --> 00:27:34,15
occurred over this winter surely it can you
know the good news is that our chapter

339
00:27:34,16 --> 00:27:38,14
ninety allotment you know will likely
still be at up at the minimum that we

340
00:27:38,15 --> 00:27:42,89
received this year the six hundred ninety
thousand before receiving the additional

341
00:27:42,90 --> 00:27:47,87
three hundred thousand and from the Niels
tax I would putting forward I think it's

342
00:27:48,07 --> 00:27:52,84
probably another two hundred ten thousand
or thereabouts and then we're also

343
00:27:53,72 --> 00:28:00,53
bringing forward forty three thousand
from the prior year that we from meals

344
00:28:00,54 --> 00:28:05,73
tax that we did not appropriate because
if it's dollars It came in you know ahead

345
00:28:05,74 --> 00:28:11,69
of plan so it's now off channeled through
our financials into free cash so that's

346
00:28:11,70 --> 00:28:12,78
why you see another line of

347
00:28:12,79 --> 00:28:16,61
a capital budget putting I think it's forty
three thousand from free cash towards

348
00:28:16,62 --> 00:28:21,30
roads because it was generated from meals
tax and that was the intent as you put it

349
00:28:21,31 --> 00:28:27,93
towards open roads. And I did want to
comment on again another thing that's

350
00:28:28,45 --> 00:28:32,60
been in development and you
know may or may not result in

351
00:28:32,61 --> 00:28:38,67
a kind of discussion by this board about
the use of the all stacks. At the end of

352
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:44,82
this fiscal year in June we'll update the
actuarial analysis on where we stand with

353
00:28:44,83 --> 00:28:51,80
the unfunded hope have liability.
And that the last time that we were

354
00:28:51,95 --> 00:28:57,93
for that we did that two years ago. You
know we were technically funding at the ARE

355
00:28:58,12 --> 00:29:01,80
WE can you know required contribution
but again that's when we had

356
00:29:01,84 --> 00:29:07,55
a lot of things going in our favor in
terms of downward pressure on cost so I'm

357
00:29:07,56 --> 00:29:14,09
very anxious to see. What this
actuarial report will say

358
00:29:14,64 --> 00:29:18,25
because if we are able to demonstrate
that we're still at the Ark and I'm not

359
00:29:18,26 --> 00:29:24,39
saying. That we will be but if we were to
be then I think that opens up you know

360
00:29:24,43 --> 00:29:29,98
another discussion for the board you know
so you know the plateau the Opeth funding

361
00:29:29,99 --> 00:29:35,81
out of meal stacks and therefore you could
shift more. Towards roads although I

362
00:29:35,82 --> 00:29:39,41
think you know Roger Hill the deep every
director should be part of that discussion

363
00:29:39,42 --> 00:29:41,14
because I think that a million dollars

364
00:29:41,15 --> 00:29:45,41
a year I think you saying that's that's
about all they can handle at this point in

365
00:29:45,42 --> 00:29:51,23
time and so if we were fortunate enough
where our roads funding is is currently at

366
00:29:51,24 --> 00:29:51,85
a at

367
00:29:51,86 --> 00:29:57,28
a nice level so that we can make an impact
on the roads and if our open liability

368
00:29:57,29 --> 00:30:01,94
could be addressed at the arc annually then
there's an opportunity for the board to

369
00:30:01,95 --> 00:30:05,43
discuss something like I'll just throw one
idea out there and it's not mine it's

370
00:30:05,44 --> 00:30:11,29
actually you know there's bills idea and
that was a building maintenance fund as

371
00:30:11,30 --> 00:30:12,39
a possibility but again that's

372
00:30:12,40 --> 00:30:16,43
a policy decision that you know that this
board would take up but so we're hoping

373
00:30:16,44 --> 00:30:20,83
that that with everything that's been done
to date that maybe these two programs

374
00:30:21,55 --> 00:30:27,07
might be reaching the level of funding
that supports them. And there might be an

375
00:30:27,08 --> 00:30:31,53
opportunity to then address the other large
liability that the town has which is

376
00:30:31,54 --> 00:30:38,49
its buildings thank you in. Feels
that to you Jimi. I want to thank

377
00:30:38,50 --> 00:30:40,35
you for the year reign D.

378
00:30:40,36 --> 00:30:41,25
And Bill for

379
00:30:41,26 --> 00:30:48,15
a very smooth budget process. That was
given take. But I think everything

380
00:30:48,16 --> 00:30:52,69
was done feeling and thanks also to the
advisory committee who reviewed the budget

381
00:30:53,55 --> 00:30:59,06
they ask good questions and I wonder can
virtually the manages to present the

382
00:30:59,07 --> 00:31:03,37
budget to me and come they gave for
the answers so I thought it was

383
00:31:03,38 --> 00:31:08,74
a good process. So I went
thank everybody that's.

384
00:31:10,29 --> 00:31:13,95
Tracy Vassily is chairman of the advisory
committee would you like to make any

385
00:31:13,96 --> 00:31:14,51
comments.

386
00:31:22,89 --> 00:31:27,82
Thank you. I just wanted to kind of share
the process I know you often join our

387
00:31:27,83 --> 00:31:31,91
meetings which I thank you all for and just
want to acknowledge the work that Randy

388
00:31:31,92 --> 00:31:36,86
does to help our our whole process go as
smoothly as it does every year and to bill

389
00:31:36,87 --> 00:31:41,43
for and Mary Beth for the work that they
did since January we vetted all the

390
00:31:41,44 --> 00:31:46,05
budgets that's involved that's involved
the liaison's from the advisory committee

391
00:31:46,06 --> 00:31:46,58
of which there is

392
00:31:46,59 --> 00:31:51,35
a lead and then other members meeting
with each of the department heads they in

393
00:31:51,36 --> 00:31:56,72
turn came and the department heads presented
their budgets to the board we did

394
00:31:56,76 --> 00:32:01,50
bring three budgets back for additional
questions and information they were

395
00:32:01,51 --> 00:32:06,83
recreation conservation in the schools and
those follow up discussions went very

396
00:32:06,84 --> 00:32:13,44
well and we did we have completed our
voting on the budget items and all of them

397
00:32:13,48 --> 00:32:17,46
will not unanimous will be recommended
by the Advisory Committee at the Town

398
00:32:17,47 --> 00:32:23,78
Meeting thanks very much to
thank you thank you so. Oh

399
00:32:24,58 --> 00:32:30,78
come on up I'm sure you can
step up and. I thank you.

400
00:32:32,09 --> 00:32:36,51
I just basically have one question for
yourself I'm sorry you have to yeah I mean

401
00:32:36,52 --> 00:32:40,02
you know Larry started six merry way and
speaking on behalf of myself and other

402
00:32:40,03 --> 00:32:45,76
advisers. I guess the basic question
is when we talk about balanced budget

403
00:32:47,19 --> 00:32:54,16
it pretty much means that we're spending
as much as we receive correct so for

404
00:32:54,17 --> 00:32:58,28
maximizing our revenue increase
by forty percent which was

405
00:32:58,32 --> 00:33:05,12
a max. To an epicenter from taxes and
growth on top of that So balance

406
00:33:05,13 --> 00:33:11,74
means that we balance it up by spending
exactly what we came in right. Which is in

407
00:33:11,75 --> 00:33:17,07
me. There's. That's one of the.

408
00:33:18,46 --> 00:33:21,54
Secrets to Foxborough his
financial success without having

409
00:33:21,55 --> 00:33:26,92
a general override says that we do not spend
all of the revenue that we receive you

410
00:33:26,93 --> 00:33:33,77
know we consciously. Design the financing
of the budget to generate at least two

411
00:33:33,78 --> 00:33:40,57
million dollars of free cash and
that's done in the following ways we

412
00:33:40,86 --> 00:33:47,80
under as we under. Fun The local
receipts dollars that we take

413
00:33:47,81 --> 00:33:52,55
in that's all the fines fees permits payment
of taxes Motor Vehicle Excise to the

414
00:33:52,56 --> 00:33:53,31
tune of a million

415
00:33:53,32 --> 00:33:58,21
a half dollars every year based on our
estimates about sixty lines and you can

416
00:33:58,22 --> 00:34:02,21
usually come pretty close on and then there's
another of the half million that will

417
00:34:02,22 --> 00:34:07,42
trickle in from unspent budgets because
they cannot be spent it cannot be overspent

418
00:34:07,43 --> 00:34:08,75
so they have to be there understand

419
00:34:08,79 --> 00:34:13,79
a spat at all that the level their budget
and then changes on our balance sheet and

420
00:34:13,83 --> 00:34:18,36
this year we actually. Went further below.

421
00:34:20,60 --> 00:34:26,24
Our revenue. By one million nine hundred
fifty thousand local receipts so we've

422
00:34:26,25 --> 00:34:30,46
estimated local receives to grow to a
certain level but we've only committed

423
00:34:31,36 --> 00:34:35,84
a proxy to me in less than that OK so
that's good information that I may not have

424
00:34:35,85 --> 00:34:39,78
known so the four to have percent increase
in revenue represents how much money.

425
00:34:42,67 --> 00:34:48,14
Roughly three million bucks three million
profit so what did expenses grow by.

426
00:34:49,92 --> 00:34:55,02
In total Well yeah is it the same with it
I mean half its balance it has to be the

427
00:34:55,03 --> 00:35:00,49
same so the expenses rose by three
million also. So would we save money.

428
00:35:02,39 --> 00:35:07,56
Is this say I thought your point was is
that we spend everything that we have. My

429
00:35:07,57 --> 00:35:11,53
point is we increase the revenue by three
million dollars and we spent an extra

430
00:35:11,54 --> 00:35:16,51
three million dollars as acar No I mean
right revenues could support an incremental

431
00:35:16,51 --> 00:35:22,08
. Two million dollars in spending OK but
we but we don't we choose not to spend

432
00:35:22,09 --> 00:35:27,11
that so that the real reason we do that
is in order to provide the financial

433
00:35:27,12 --> 00:35:33,11
flexibility to the town so that when times
are hard meaning like state aid declines

434
00:35:33,12 --> 00:35:39,48
or other other receipts decline that we
count on that we're able to maintain what

435
00:35:39,55 --> 00:35:40,44
has consistently been

436
00:35:40,63 --> 00:35:45,57
a policy direction from both the boards
like and school committee to maintain

437
00:35:45,58 --> 00:35:47,05
services I.E.

438
00:35:47,06 --> 00:35:53,75
Operating budgets and cut back
on capital to defer those those

439
00:35:53,76 --> 00:35:58,50
purchases in order to maintain maintain
services so we don't we don't fluctuate you

440
00:35:58,51 --> 00:35:59,56
know revenues drop by

441
00:35:59,57 --> 00:36:04,21
a million dollars And therefore we have
five million dollars to cut we maintain

442
00:36:04,31 --> 00:36:08,40
a reserve just by under budgeting of revenues
that we have so that we can maintain

443
00:36:08,41 --> 00:36:12,17
some consistency of services case there I'm
just I haven't heard the number yet so

444
00:36:12,82 --> 00:36:18,22
the fourth have percent increase in
revenue was how much. I mean you know.

445
00:36:29,14 --> 00:36:34,80
Three point one three
point one Total. OK in

446
00:36:34,81 --> 00:36:40,40
a committed revenue in the community OK.
But what about in total non-committed is

447
00:36:40,41 --> 00:36:44,53
what it is again approx me another two
million dollars on top of that so that's

448
00:36:44,54 --> 00:36:49,98
done for free cash that yeah that will
ultimately flow from cash I could think you

449
00:36:50,27 --> 00:36:57,10
know. Taking any other
questions. I'd like to thank

450
00:36:57,11 --> 00:37:00,35
Bill Mary Beth and Randy for doing such

451
00:37:00,36 --> 00:37:04,62
a great job and also for the thanks to
the school for many that you know the

452
00:37:04,63 --> 00:37:08,65
history of collaboration between them
in this bill budget side and the school

453
00:37:08,66 --> 00:37:14,64
budget side has done the town well we really
appreciate your efforts and also thank

454
00:37:14,65 --> 00:37:21,49
the advisory committee for their many hours
and their in-depth analysis always very

455
00:37:21,50 --> 00:37:26,64
interesting to listen to some Thank you
mention I just I just would be remiss if I

456
00:37:26,65 --> 00:37:30,16
didn't they also thank the school committee
in their efforts meetings with them

457
00:37:30,17 --> 00:37:36,13
have been extremely productive.
In that it's it's no lie that

458
00:37:36,89 --> 00:37:41,67
it's no secret rather that the that this
committee provides an excellent value for

459
00:37:41,68 --> 00:37:46,96
throws with from the education the education
program has is extremely highly rated

460
00:37:47,55 --> 00:37:48,99
and I think they do

461
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:53,80
a terrific job with what they have and. To
get in there as if they could value for

462
00:37:53,81 --> 00:37:57,92
the dollars in their program so I'm very
pleased with the work really ship that we

463
00:37:57,93 --> 00:38:04,41
have and I hope it continues I hope I know
is continuing to well in the future. And

464
00:38:04,42 --> 00:38:05,61
it also sets us to

465
00:38:05,62 --> 00:38:09,00
a missed statements out there we had one
more risk that I'd be remiss if I didn't

466
00:38:09,01 --> 00:38:10,94
say this it's been kind of

467
00:38:10,95 --> 00:38:16,61
a pet peeve for five years now and. Talk
about the meals tax and it is going up and

468
00:38:17,07 --> 00:38:23,00
I think we if you remember when we voted
on this at town hall it was we had certain

469
00:38:23,01 --> 00:38:28,99
projections at the meals tax because it
was new or is it one percent. And the

470
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:33,11
reason I think that it passed
was because we said it is

471
00:38:33,12 --> 00:38:35,26
a tax and nobody likes tax
but if it was going to be

472
00:38:35,27 --> 00:38:40,05
a tax it was going to go to our future the
OPAP it was going to go to our roads and

473
00:38:40,06 --> 00:38:45,29
now it seems like we're getting. You know
the state continues to be level with

474
00:38:45,30 --> 00:38:49,48
their money that comes in for this for the
roads plus we have all this revenue for

475
00:38:49,49 --> 00:38:52,84
the meals tax plus it's more
than we thought if we make

476
00:38:52,85 --> 00:38:58,16
a change in his apologies to change that
and we're changing it from OPAP which is

477
00:38:58,17 --> 00:39:03,47
paying the retirement. For the people
that are here today at town hall plus the

478
00:39:03,48 --> 00:39:08,96
generations before before we take it away
from that and take it away from roads and

479
00:39:08,97 --> 00:39:10,67
put it towards other thing
I think it has to be

480
00:39:10,68 --> 00:39:13,34
a robust discussion at
this table and not just

481
00:39:13,35 --> 00:39:17,43
a quick question if you were here at that
hearings in which it just sort of those

482
00:39:17,44 --> 00:39:21,22
discussions I think we've been steadfast
in our approach to say oh yeah I've been

483
00:39:21,23 --> 00:39:22,71
using words My point is other

484
00:39:22,72 --> 00:39:27,90
a mess if I'm adamantly against spending
it on anything else entertaining me now

485
00:39:27,91 --> 00:39:32,46
that the discussion but I don't want to
be just able put it out there and discuss

486
00:39:32,47 --> 00:39:33,38
it because it's

487
00:39:33,39 --> 00:39:37,73
a new idea but I'm. All right you know I
think I just I think just to be clear

488
00:39:37,74 --> 00:39:41,54
about that I think what really IS point
is that if we're able to address those

489
00:39:41,55 --> 00:39:45,78
items adequately have money left over the
question is What do you want to do with

490
00:39:45,79 --> 00:39:49,79
the reserve and I think that's the core
conversation we want to have with everyone

491
00:39:49,80 --> 00:39:53,19
here I mean I don't think we're not going
to we're going to just take on that

492
00:39:53,20 --> 00:39:57,30
decision in him do that without without
it with discussion with everyone because

493
00:39:57,31 --> 00:40:02,06
it's an important policy discussion and
those so the only thing that we've

494
00:40:02,10 --> 00:40:05,54
introduced to for consideration which we
have when I even there yet because we

495
00:40:05,55 --> 00:40:09,04
haven't even we don't have all of the
information for all the pieces but if we end

496
00:40:09,05 --> 00:40:09,27
up in

497
00:40:09,28 --> 00:40:13,75
a place where we do have some additional
capability there the question is are there

498
00:40:13,76 --> 00:40:18,02
other areas that you want to dedicate them
for the funding for provided that you're

499
00:40:18,03 --> 00:40:22,31
with rescue or could rescue no one when we
have that discussion once we have better

500
00:40:22,32 --> 00:40:26,54
information on the Oprah book do you believe
the actuarial results will usually be

501
00:40:26,55 --> 00:40:32,68
done you know by the end of the. Calendar
year and I just want to clarify I have

502
00:40:33,18 --> 00:40:39,01
a vague. Sense of incorrect messages I
don't see us moving away from the seven

503
00:40:39,02 --> 00:40:39,73
hundred thousand

504
00:40:39,74 --> 00:40:43,45
a year funding very currently for hope
have I see that needing to continue at

505
00:40:43,46 --> 00:40:50,22
a minimum you know
perpetuity. Thank you. To

506
00:40:50,26 --> 00:40:57,17
get the most you are nuts but.
I move the border so what will

507
00:40:57,18 --> 00:41:02,67
accept the fiscal year two thousand and
sixteen budget as presented actually this

508
00:41:02,68 --> 00:41:02,99
is a bit of

509
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:09,74
a myth and so is it with operating
the operating. Thank you discussion

510
00:41:10,68 --> 00:41:10,97
both as

511
00:41:10,98 --> 00:41:18,42
a favor and I thank you.
Thank you. Happy couple

512
00:41:18,43 --> 00:41:25,17
but it. Still be. Kept me me again

513
00:41:25,48 --> 00:41:32,07
this year as it always does and soon all
the requests all the departments and. All

514
00:41:32,08 --> 00:41:38,47
of the requests are able to be funded
with the exception of for. The end of the

515
00:41:38,48 --> 00:41:44,98
total supported was two point five two
point four million dollars. And there was

516
00:41:44,99 --> 00:41:50,91
a good list of items from a variety of
different departments I know you have

517
00:41:50,92 --> 00:41:55,25
a copy of of the article. But
there are some good there was

518
00:41:55,26 --> 00:42:02,22
a real significant give and take.
And I think in particular I think

519
00:42:02,78 --> 00:42:05,86
really want to talk about. The D.P.

520
00:42:05,87 --> 00:42:12,50
Gov director and how he made it all work.
Because I'd just like to to knowledge of

521
00:42:13,09 --> 00:42:15,56
Roger Hill and his is the pilot for taking

522
00:42:15,57 --> 00:42:19,19
a step back so we could see some other
important issues such as the lighting for

523
00:42:19,20 --> 00:42:23,14
the field be addressed this year or in the
future no it's an important opportunity

524
00:42:23,15 --> 00:42:27,50
it will put the window for that
consideration and that again

525
00:42:27,51 --> 00:42:31,41
a very collaborative process which we were
able to address really all the items on

526
00:42:31,42 --> 00:42:36,77
the on the list this year which doesn't
usually happen so I think. The thing is it

527
00:42:36,78 --> 00:42:36,88
was

528
00:42:36,89 --> 00:42:40,04
a great process really appreciate everybody's
effort to try and get to that final

529
00:42:40,05 --> 00:42:46,69
moment and know that as is tradition with
funding our non building capital needs

530
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:52,74
and no borrowing required to do that all
funded from cash or and just needed you

531
00:42:52,75 --> 00:42:59,17
know grants like chapter happened I
didn't have that so no no debt issuance.

532
00:43:04,06 --> 00:43:09,14
I just want to say that I thought the
process was really great. One we had again

533
00:43:09,15 --> 00:43:14,52
Tracey the silly from the advisory committee
bill branding myself and Roger and

534
00:43:14,64 --> 00:43:21,63
Spinelli. From the school and. The outcome

535
00:43:21,64 --> 00:43:27,62
I think it's terrific that we again thank
you Roger for your. Innovation and likes

536
00:43:27,63 --> 00:43:33,29
ability for making this happen so anybody
have any questions on any particular

537
00:43:33,30 --> 00:43:40,19
items. And. I'm of the Bourse

538
00:43:40,20 --> 00:43:46,37
what's been approved Article five
the two thousand and sixteen C.I.

539
00:43:46,57 --> 00:43:52,18
He budget is presented can. You discuss.

540
00:43:53,46 --> 00:43:56,90
All those in favor. If you.

541
00:44:06,40 --> 00:44:10,99
OK The next item on our agenda is the joint
meeting Board of Selectmen with water

542
00:44:11,00 --> 00:44:14,88
and sewer commissioners and advisory
committee and planning board.

543
00:44:18,95 --> 00:44:24,60
Water and Sewer commissioners do you want
to come up in front of your. Bench if I

544
00:44:24,61 --> 00:44:25,06
could just take

545
00:44:25,07 --> 00:44:29,41
a few most help and try and frame the
discussion for those that would be home grown

546
00:44:29,42 --> 00:44:32,06
away for when you get your
first but if you think you're.

547
00:44:37,21 --> 00:44:37,63
Going to get.

548
00:44:51,64 --> 00:44:53,81
Three. Just as

00:44:53,82 --> 00:45:00,28
a first. Order ready to produce the draft.

550
00:45:15,24 --> 00:45:19,51
Maybe you need even if you
want to call your meetings or.

551
00:45:25,70 --> 00:45:28,29
Yeah. But from what I'm wearing

552

like to thank you do other or any other

554
00:45:42,07 --> 00:45:46,69
boards that want me to call that means the
world and all the planning board is here

555
00:45:46,69 --> 00:45:52,30
. When they all said.
I could get Fred off.

556
00:45:53,54 --> 00:45:59,39
Thank you and add comment I was here with
him MC I come here as well so so thanks

557
00:45:59,40 --> 00:46:01,25
everyone for being here
tonight and this is

558
00:46:01,26 --> 00:46:05,81
a important discussion so much so that I
I specifically asked for additional time

559
00:46:05,82 --> 00:46:12,28
to sort of get this the issues out in the
forefront tonight because ultimately this

560
00:46:12,29 --> 00:46:16,55
is an important policy consideration which
I know that we all have some of points

561
00:46:16,56 --> 00:46:20,93
things to talk about. So just to
frame this discussion this is

562
00:46:20,94 --> 00:46:26,24
a discussion about. The executive powers
of the town water water and sewer

563
00:46:26,25 --> 00:46:28,23
commission which just to get

564
00:46:28,24 --> 00:46:31,98
a little bit of history apparently was
altered in June two thousand and thirteen

565
00:46:31,99 --> 00:46:32,12
through

566
00:46:32,13 --> 00:46:35,88
a change in the in the charter I was I
wasn't here during that period of time so I

567
00:46:35,89 --> 00:46:40,28
can't really speak to the specifics of what
happened but all I know is that the it

568
00:46:40,29 --> 00:46:42,01
was it was later discovered that there was

569
00:46:42,02 --> 00:46:47,02
a concern about whether or not that the
change that was made went further than what

570
00:46:47,03 --> 00:46:48,98
was fully intended to happen that was to

571
00:46:48,99 --> 00:46:53,36
a missionary trying to just allow the Tommies
you have authority over the personnel

572
00:46:53,37 --> 00:46:56,85
and in the in the water sewer commission
on the ones who commission that would hope

573
00:46:56,86 --> 00:46:59,31
would be in as good as by the D.P.W.

574
00:46:59,31 --> 00:47:05,27
. It's my understanding that discussion
that to change the member that was that was

575
00:47:05,28 --> 00:47:08,23
done actually one perhaps a little
bit further than that and as

576
00:47:08,24 --> 00:47:14,59
a result that's the reason why this this
motion this this action is here tonight. I

577
00:47:14,60 --> 00:47:18,98
think in further than that is it that
there's been further discussions about the

578
00:47:18,99 --> 00:47:23,42
sort program and in the end that the changes
that have been forthcoming with the

579
00:47:23,43 --> 00:47:28,05
new program or any of that added capacity
that the town now has as part of being

580
00:47:28,06 --> 00:47:31,93
part of the regional So a program with
no one in Mansfield and so therefore

581
00:47:31,94 --> 00:47:36,64
a lot of the town to have some additional
capacity in it that will allow us to to

582
00:47:36,65 --> 00:47:40,21
address many of the economic development
issues that the town has been looking to

583
00:47:40,22 --> 00:47:46,00
try to address for many many years so
with that in mind there's been some

584
00:47:46,01 --> 00:47:50,97
discussion about the possibility of selling
some capacity outside the borders of

585
00:47:50,98 --> 00:47:57,87
the time which for for really well intended
reasons I understand why the the in

586
00:47:57,88 --> 00:48:01,64
the discussion is taking place obviously
to address some of the finances associated

587
00:48:01,65 --> 00:48:06,04
with this with the with the the with
participation the new plant and the debt

588
00:48:06,05 --> 00:48:07,84
service that goes along with with Optus

589
00:48:07,85 --> 00:48:12,52
a patient. So with that in mind I think
the there are three important issues that

590
00:48:12,53 --> 00:48:16,82
we really need to try try and discuss and
try to bring some resolution to tonight

591
00:48:16,84 --> 00:48:20,90
and that is the issue of finances and I've
asked many scholars to be here tonight

592
00:48:20,90 --> 00:48:23,90
to actually address some of the issues of
the finances so we're clear on what the

593
00:48:23,90 --> 00:48:28,11
finances actually mean when the payments
are do how much debt service is involved

594
00:48:28,11 --> 00:48:32,83
here so we can actually have the ability
to to explain that to everyone so

595
00:48:32,84 --> 00:48:38,20
everybody's fully on board about what that
truly means. And into the issue of The

596
00:48:38,21 --> 00:48:44,79
Long and short term strategy for Ford
So we use so that we know over the long

597
00:48:44,93 --> 00:48:49,53
long short term what are the needs that
need to be addressed from the town in that

598
00:48:49,61 --> 00:48:53,86
you know how we are we fully considered
all those those those prospects before we

599
00:48:53,87 --> 00:49:00,71
consider the sale of. Some capacity
outside the borders and then third of

600
00:49:00,72 --> 00:49:06,34
course of that is the authority the SO
Commission has has in WA and should continue

601
00:49:06,35 --> 00:49:11,06
to be the in my opinion industry it's really
my opinion they have the authority to

602
00:49:11,44 --> 00:49:16,19
sue over the sale capacity within the system
and in particular even within the town

603
00:49:16,67 --> 00:49:20,62
the question really that's be forced
tonight is whether is is should there be

604
00:49:20,66 --> 00:49:23,82
a check and balance in
place for the sale of so

605
00:49:23,83 --> 00:49:28,86
a capacity if it goes outside the borders
of the town and perhaps and then if that

606
00:49:28,87 --> 00:49:30,67
is in fact true it should if there is

607
00:49:30,94 --> 00:49:36,19
a need to do that what should that mechanism
be so there isn't anybody here tonight

608
00:49:36,20 --> 00:49:37,45
that I know of that really has

609
00:49:37,46 --> 00:49:43,10
a set. Solution to this and I think really
what we have to talk about is first of

610
00:49:43,11 --> 00:49:48,83
all is there an issue number one in two if
there is how we address it so I doze or

611
00:49:48,84 --> 00:49:52,88
three bullet points I think that we really
need to try to address tonight so to

612
00:49:52,89 --> 00:49:56,27
understand the finances of this I think
that's really important because I give the

613
00:49:56,28 --> 00:49:58,92
credit all the credit to the to the so

614
00:49:58,93 --> 00:50:02,85
a commission for making sure that where
they are being cognizant of the rate payers

615
00:50:03,28 --> 00:50:06,61
and as we all are I think I don't get it
there's anyone in the room that doesn't

616
00:50:06,62 --> 00:50:06,74
get

617
00:50:06,75 --> 00:50:10,82
a call to say that but there it's for for
it's it's really in the forefront of their

618
00:50:10,83 --> 00:50:14,29
minds that it has to be addressed
and we don't result in

619
00:50:14,30 --> 00:50:19,10
a situation I could get expensive for the
rate payers and we're all on the what

620
00:50:19,11 --> 00:50:22,82
about that the question is what's the
right way to address that and I'd like to

621
00:50:22,83 --> 00:50:24,29
turn over three a possible say

622
00:50:24,30 --> 00:50:47,89
a few words about. Good

623
00:50:47,90 --> 00:50:48,39
evening again.

624
00:50:59,80 --> 00:51:02,35
I was asked to. Take

625
00:51:02,36 --> 00:51:08,86
a look at the. Debt burden that the.

626
00:51:09,96 --> 00:51:16,70
Water enterprise. Will be responsible
for. The once the the permanent

627
00:51:16,71 --> 00:51:23,11
financing is just put in place. For the for
this project the expansion of sewer as

628
00:51:23,12 --> 00:51:30,10
well as the. Renovation of the
existing plant and so I've reviewed

629
00:51:30,11 --> 00:51:37,11
the financing docu are they that
modeling documents. That have been

630
00:51:37,15 --> 00:51:43,85
worked on by the. Consultant for the for
the water and sewer commissioners and

631
00:51:44,20 --> 00:51:50,83
my take on the financing obligation
that we're looking at in summary is.

632
00:51:51,85 --> 00:51:56,78
Leave the number that we will likely our
share of the number that will likely need

633
00:51:56,79 --> 00:52:00,12
to pay the debt service on
that proximately five and

634
00:52:00,13 --> 00:52:02,63
a half million dollars. Five and

635
00:52:02,64 --> 00:52:08,98
a quarter of that is the town's share of
all of the enhancements and expansion to

636
00:52:08,99 --> 00:52:14,30
the plant and then there are some other
costs in addition to that that Nance field

637
00:52:14,34 --> 00:52:20,15
is absorbing for the
other regional M. And F.

638
00:52:20,19 --> 00:52:25,79
And and then they will likely load that
on to the debt that is file that is

639
00:52:25,80 --> 00:52:32,20
initially. Issued in approximately
fiscal two thousand and

640
00:52:32,21 --> 00:52:36,82
eighteen and about another quarter million
dollars rough and tough should bring the

641
00:52:36,83 --> 00:52:40,98
total principal debt service that will
be responsible for for about five and

642
00:52:40,99 --> 00:52:47,07
a half million dollars And again the
understanding is that it would likely be

643
00:52:47,08 --> 00:52:53,30
issued and physically seen by the regional
districts our share would you know would

644
00:52:53,31 --> 00:52:58,32
be our responsibility we would have to go
out to buy to want for it we would just

645
00:52:58,33 --> 00:53:03,59
submit our debt service
payments. To the regional.

646
00:53:06,37 --> 00:53:11,00
And again so it's we're talking approximately
three fiscal years out before the

647
00:53:11,01 --> 00:53:17,86
debt service. Would start
and the over the next five

648
00:53:17,87 --> 00:53:23,03
years if you look out five years. Our
total debt service assuming you know two

649
00:53:23,04 --> 00:53:26,38
point four percent interest rate which
could be even better depending upon the

650
00:53:26,86 --> 00:53:31,40
financing that the regionals is
able to get would be just less than

651
00:53:31,41 --> 00:53:37,06
a million dollars over the next five
years zero over the next two and about

652
00:53:37,07 --> 00:53:39,89
a million dollars over the
following three so but

653
00:53:39,90 --> 00:53:45,94
a million dollars roughly just under that
over the next five years and what I've

654
00:53:45,95 --> 00:53:52,06
done on this on the stand out is. Just
try to equate that to how much capacity

655
00:53:52,07 --> 00:53:57,55
would would need to be sold in order to
just handle the debt service. And that

656
00:53:57,56 --> 00:54:02,12
would be approximately twenty three thousand
gallons at that the price that's been

657
00:54:02,23 --> 00:54:07,19
discussed by the water and sewer commissioners.
And as you can see I chalked out

658
00:54:07,23 --> 00:54:10,64
the schedule and you know five year
increment so you could see how much of the

659
00:54:10,65 --> 00:54:16,32
hundred seventy thousand gallons that is
being acquired here I would need to be

660
00:54:16,33 --> 00:54:21,15
sold over time just to handle the debt
service and as you can see it's currently

661
00:54:21,16 --> 00:54:25,100
it's at twenty seven year schedule that
can change depending upon how the the

662
00:54:26,01 --> 00:54:27,96
Regional of me wants an
issue the debt would be

663
00:54:27,97 --> 00:54:32,21
a thirty year schedule to be twenty five
years schedule or probably something close

664
00:54:32,22 --> 00:54:34,15
to this so I feel it's

665
00:54:34,16 --> 00:54:40,87
a pretty good proxy so it's not that we
have to it's sell one hundred seventy

666
00:54:40,88 --> 00:54:43,97
thousand gallons right out of a
gate or come up with five and

667
00:54:43,98 --> 00:54:47,17
a half million dollars out of the gate you
certainly have to come up with that that

668
00:54:47,18 --> 00:54:52,74
money plus the interest about seven point
four million dollars over twenty seven

669
00:54:52,75 --> 00:54:58,72
years but as you can see it's something
that we would need to find over time it.

670
00:54:59,96 --> 00:55:06,37
Quicker it. Altered
back over to you to the

671
00:55:06,88 --> 00:55:10,85
perhaps we could maybe like to hear from
that sort of pushed as to why what that

672
00:55:10,86 --> 00:55:16,89
what their thoughts are on this with OK
Thank you Bill First off any questions from

673
00:55:16,90 --> 00:55:19,13
anyone from Randy at this point.

674
00:55:23,93 --> 00:55:30,76
There's more copies of your two.
Any questions plenty of. OK

675
00:55:31,60 --> 00:55:37,00
ready. On the number so so when you get
to twenty here twenty twenty you say it's

676
00:55:37,01 --> 00:55:41,09
about twenty three thousand gallons that
you need to sell to breakeven for the

677
00:55:41,10 --> 00:55:46,34
payments for that and then we get five
years later there's another thirty six

678
00:55:46,35 --> 00:55:50,96
thousand gallons is that on top of your
slightly top of so you cumulative so the

679
00:55:51,17 --> 00:55:58,17
total of the the the gallon column is hundred
seventy thousand of capacity that is

680
00:55:58,18 --> 00:56:02,09
the entirety of what's being purchased in
the experience over the next twenty seven

681
00:56:02,10 --> 00:56:06,00
years you have broken it down intervals
of five years twenty two thousand thirty

682
00:56:06,01 --> 00:56:11,73
six thousand basically around thirty
thousand gallons correctly year over five

683
00:56:11,74 --> 00:56:17,87
years and in the. The reason I broke
it out like this is because I

684
00:56:18,26 --> 00:56:25,26
understand and I can appreciate the.
Concern of having to come up with

685
00:56:25,27 --> 00:56:31,35
all of this money certainly on the we
certainly wouldn't want to put this burden on

686
00:56:31,36 --> 00:56:35,16
the existing sewer rate
payers I know that's a that's

687
00:56:35,20 --> 00:56:39,86
a feeling that the waters are commissioners
are guarding against religiously from

688
00:56:39,87 --> 00:56:43,36
the from the beginning here but what I
wanted to show is that at least over the

689
00:56:43,37 --> 00:56:48,95
next five years if this is the debt
service that would be looking at it for

690
00:56:49,07 --> 00:56:55,72
whatever reason there was an inability to
sell those twenty three thousand gallons

691
00:56:55,73 --> 00:57:01,63
over the next five years that the town
treasury certainly has the capacity within

692
00:57:01,64 --> 00:57:08,52
its cash balances in order to could loan
you know that million dollars to the

693
00:57:09,10 --> 00:57:11,91
the water and sewer of the sewer
enterprise so that that's

694
00:57:11,92 --> 00:57:17,72
a possibility I just want to I don't
want the policy boards here to be making

695
00:57:17,73 --> 00:57:24,31
decisions without knowing that you know
we do have ways to do the short term fund

696
00:57:24,32 --> 00:57:29,18
within our own Treasury the Treasury has
in any given day anywhere from fifteen to

697
00:57:29,19 --> 00:57:34,76
thirty million dollars that we have and
were allowed by law to to mingle you know

698
00:57:34,84 --> 00:57:38,97
those funds they're all accounted for
separately in our ledgers but you can mingle

699
00:57:38,98 --> 00:57:45,82
them and so we are allowed to to offer
you know this relatively short term

700
00:57:45,90 --> 00:57:52,20
amount of money and until the in also
related but not knowing what's on the books

701
00:57:52,37 --> 00:57:56,23
a potential development in or out of
town if developments came on housing

702
00:57:56,24 --> 00:58:00,80
developments or retailer supermarkets or
whatever and also and in four years they

703
00:58:00,81 --> 00:58:05,55
wanted to bring eighty thousand gallons
into the town or into his field and beyond

704
00:58:06,19 --> 00:58:10,94
that it's almost like paying your mortgage
off early you could. Bill for that and

705
00:58:11,09 --> 00:58:15,12
get that added revenue early and pay
off it early right now and I think the

706
00:58:15,13 --> 00:58:16,39
commissions are probably feel

707
00:58:16,40 --> 00:58:19,43
a lot more comfortable having that cushion
in the bank because at the end of the

708
00:58:19,44 --> 00:58:23,78
day they still would have to come up with
you know the seven roughly seven point

709
00:58:23,79 --> 00:58:28,66
four million over the over the twenty
seven years and include the interest so

710
00:58:29,04 --> 00:58:32,56
selling eighty thousand is great but they
still ultimately need to sell hundred

711
00:58:32,57 --> 00:58:37,03
seventy just in order to cover to cover
the debt service but the near term

712
00:58:37,04 --> 00:58:43,19
concerned I I believe is and my my opinion
is minimized in the next five years

713
00:58:43,50 --> 00:58:48,34
given that the town certainly can and work
with the with the commissioners to make

714
00:58:48,35 --> 00:58:51,06
sure that you know there is no
unfortunate rate raising That's

715
00:58:51,07 --> 00:58:55,65
a worst case scenario that's if there's no
new customers coming in to buy this flow

716
00:58:55,84 --> 00:59:02,83
correct OK Thank you. For the
finance related question.

717
00:59:06,47 --> 00:59:13,22
Might. You like to. Make
some comments or give us

718
00:59:13,24 --> 00:59:19,14
a statement. And the only
thing I'd like to say is.

719
00:59:20,49 --> 00:59:21,54
I think we're doing

720
00:59:21,55 --> 00:59:27,64
a disservice to the voting public by taking
two very important issues and confusing

721
00:59:27,65 --> 00:59:34,44
them they warrant an article is to clean
up legislation that was misrepresented

722
00:59:35,99 --> 00:59:40,23
has nothing to do with the sale at so
capacity whether it be in town out of town

723
00:59:41,08 --> 00:59:47,15
and I've personally wrestled over the past
few meetings with the fact that we've

724
00:59:47,66 --> 00:59:53,62
had this issue of the authority of the
water and sewer commission and we seem to

725
00:59:53,68 --> 00:59:59,50
find ourselves talking about the sale of
sewer capacity. This issue needs to be

726
00:59:59,51 --> 01:00:05,43
addressed and cleaned up and whatever
conversations need to be had about the sale

727
01:00:05,44 --> 01:00:05,63
so

728
01:00:05,64 --> 01:00:11,73
a capacity should be had and I think the
opinion of this board at least myself is I'd

729
01:00:11,74 --> 01:00:16,27
be more than happy to have that conversation
with anybody and everybody but we need

730
01:00:16,28 --> 01:00:22,25
to stop introducing the article to one
article as if it has anything to do with the

731
01:00:22,26 --> 01:00:28,93
seller so it begs the whether be in
town out of town because even as

732
01:00:28,94 --> 01:00:34,85
a board member sitting on it I find myself
to be somewhat confused if the public

733
01:00:34,86 --> 01:00:38,68
needs to understand one has nothing to
do with the other there is an issue with

734
01:00:38,69 --> 01:00:45,59
authority whether. A legal opinion that
this board has the authority to ever

735
01:00:45,67 --> 01:00:52,53
really do nothing now if there is
perceived to be the intention when I was

736
01:00:52,54 --> 01:00:59,30
put into place back in December of two
thousand and twelve. I don't think anybody's

737
01:00:59,31 --> 01:01:03,95
of that opinion that it was ever set out
to completely strip the water and sewer

738
01:01:03,96 --> 01:01:10,68
commission of all authority and at least
from our perspective the only way to clean

739
01:01:10,69 --> 01:01:15,84
that up is to go back in and not add
anything to it not mess with it but make it

740
01:01:15,85 --> 01:01:21,81
right and that's the way we
presented. The war an article and

741
01:01:22,62 --> 01:01:29,18
hope that everybody will support it and
any issues as far as who's buying sewer

742
01:01:29,19 --> 01:01:33,16
aware should be sold more than happy to
have that conversation but let's let's get

743
01:01:33,17 --> 01:01:33,78
this resolved.

744
01:01:46,13 --> 01:01:50,25
With the playing board like to
make any comments this time.

745
01:01:55,32 --> 01:02:00,98
Well just in terms of the master plan we
just we are only concern is that. All of

746
01:02:00,99 --> 01:02:06,65
us view. That this new sewer capacity as

747
01:02:06,66 --> 01:02:12,89
a town asset and that you know the town
spent a lot of years and a lot of money on

748
01:02:12,90 --> 01:02:17,64
a comprehensive wastewater treatment plan
probably needs to be relooked at some

749
01:02:17,65 --> 01:02:22,83
point once we know that we have the the
the full flow from from the I.M.F.

750
01:02:22,91 --> 01:02:26,94
The good news is that once we
once we you know signed the I am

751
01:02:26,95 --> 01:02:31,48
a you know we're now longer going to be
dealing with household uses based on Title

752
01:02:31,49 --> 01:02:34,39
five it's going to be actual
flow which is going to be

753
01:02:34,40 --> 01:02:37,16
a big benefit to homeowners
and so it's going to be

754
01:02:37,17 --> 01:02:42,53
a big benefit to any potential
growth in the town. So just from

755
01:02:42,54 --> 01:02:48,20
a planning perspective we just want to make
sure that everybody in the town who is

756
01:02:48,61 --> 01:02:53,13
in the critical needs areas or is in an
economic development area gets taken care

757
01:02:53,14 --> 01:02:59,75
of before we deal with any future sales
to any entity that's outside of our

758
01:02:59,76 --> 01:03:03,96
borders and that's that's that's our only
that's not only dog in the fight which

759
01:03:03,97 --> 01:03:04,46
really isn't

760
01:03:04,47 --> 01:03:08,59
a dog in the fight we just want to make
sure that you know the town comes first if

761
01:03:08,60 --> 01:03:13,88
there is you know additional flow at some
point in the future that we all feel as

762
01:03:13,89 --> 01:03:15,00
a community is going to be

763
01:03:15,01 --> 01:03:20,52
a benefit in the war so we're commissioners
you know want to deal with that and the

764
01:03:20,53 --> 01:03:21,34
Board of Selectmen is

765
01:03:21,35 --> 01:03:27,06
a part of that decision and I'm sure we
would support that. That that's really

766
01:03:27,07 --> 01:03:30,09
that's really our perspective on it we
want to make sure that all that that will

767
01:03:30,10 --> 01:03:35,19
the time we're putting into this new master
planning and the other state you know.

768
01:03:36,51 --> 01:03:40,56
Planning issues that are going to come to
for you know get paid attention to and

769
01:03:40,57 --> 01:03:46,02
that we take care of all that stuff
that's that's our basic concern.

770
01:03:50,49 --> 01:03:54,91
Yes you just like just like comment on
which is which is quite good I thought I

771
01:03:54,92 --> 01:03:58,55
thought you did nice job just explaining
what the real there really is two issues

772
01:03:58,56 --> 01:04:03,82
of play here one is the authority that
goes through the commission and I haven't

773
01:04:03,83 --> 01:04:06,16
heard anyone really say that that's really

774
01:04:06,17 --> 01:04:09,16
a question that they that they want to
return the authority to that to the

775
01:04:09,17 --> 01:04:13,98
commission I guess the real question
remains though what mechanism would be in

776
01:04:13,99 --> 01:04:17,04
place to assure that

777
01:04:17,05 --> 01:04:22,36
a further discussion will be held relative
to the sale of capacity also the Tao If

778
01:04:22,37 --> 01:04:25,68
in fact there were to occur and there's
no guarantee that you're going to happen

779
01:04:25,69 --> 01:04:27,29
you may not even have a
what mechanism would be

780
01:04:27,30 --> 01:04:31,97
a place to do that so that I think
everyone has of assurance that further

781
01:04:31,98 --> 01:04:37,84
discussion is had before that actual
action took place I guess that I pose

782
01:04:37,85 --> 01:04:44,63
a question back to the Commission if they
could address that. Propose something I

783
01:04:44,64 --> 01:04:49,63
don't think were opposed to anything only
contention is that it doesn't belong in

784
01:04:49,64 --> 01:04:55,23
this legislation this needs this this
was missed misconstrued and needs to be

785
01:04:55,24 --> 01:05:00,70
cleaned up so let's clean it up the way
it should be and well and didn't want to

786
01:05:00,71 --> 01:05:06,65
taint anything. We said at least from my
personal perspective came in front of the

787
01:05:06,65 --> 01:05:13,47
Board of Selectmen at least four times
and advance of signing the I am me and I

788
01:05:13,47 --> 01:05:18,83
don't see why we would go about in any other
way or anybody else for that matter in

789
01:05:18,83 --> 01:05:23,58
oppositions. Again you know I
think I said it earlier I'm not

790
01:05:23,59 --> 01:05:27,80
a plow I have the conversation with anybody
that's well and have it appreciate that

791
01:05:27,81 --> 01:05:33,54
thank you Madam Chair just I just that not
to I want to introduce Kay Conley who

792
01:05:33,55 --> 01:05:38,32
was here on the town council tonight
representing the town of course and its team

793
01:05:38,33 --> 01:05:38,48
made

794
01:05:38,49 --> 01:05:43,23
a Sue was actually sort of special counsel
to soar water commission he said tonight

795
01:05:43,24 --> 01:05:49,11
too so I did and Roger all of course of
who was here to join us as the Commission

796
01:05:49,15 --> 01:05:52,29
into the deal to direct it
I guess that I would pose

797
01:05:52,30 --> 01:05:57,00
a question to either one of the
counsels through do you have a perhaps

798
01:05:57,01 --> 01:06:01,22
a legal mechanism that could be done that
would assure folks that if in fact that

799
01:06:01,23 --> 01:06:02,03
were to happen is there

800
01:06:02,04 --> 01:06:05,46
a way to do that that was so we wouldn't
complicate the legislation but I think

801
01:06:05,47 --> 01:06:09,92
anybody here would not looking to try and
make it complicated but we need to have I

802
01:06:09,93 --> 01:06:12,79
would think some to some assurance at least
that's my understanding of this issue

803
01:06:13,74 --> 01:06:15,32
that there's a further discussion before

804
01:06:15,45 --> 01:06:22,38
a sale of some of those would be sold
also the borders. I made it to the chair

805
01:06:22,62 --> 01:06:28,45
Steven but I was so miles will call special
counsel. Before I turn to the managers

806
01:06:28,45 --> 01:06:33,04
. The question that he posed if I could
just frame put this in context perhaps it

807
01:06:33,19 --> 01:06:38,23
may be helpful. I was brought in when
those water and sewer commissioners were

808
01:06:38,24 --> 01:06:44,83
negotiating on the district agreement
for the new sore district and that

809
01:06:44,84 --> 01:06:49,70
legislation and was somewhat surprised
to learn of all the special acts that

810
01:06:49,71 --> 01:06:55,19
Foxboro has relative to soar operations
but the history that I'm sure the cycling

811
01:06:55,20 --> 01:07:00,43
are probably all familiar with probably
more familiar than I am is that the one

812
01:07:00,44 --> 01:07:04,49
store commission was empowered by Special
Act in one nine hundred eighty four I

813
01:07:04,50 --> 01:07:08,51
believe and they they have or and I'm sorry
nine hundred eighty six chapter forty

814
01:07:08,52 --> 01:07:13,29
six of the acts of nine hundred eighty
six and he gave to the water and sewer

815
01:07:13,30 --> 01:07:17,64
commissioners all the authority previously
held by the select board to operate the

816
01:07:17,65 --> 01:07:24,50
swore operations in town and that's
how it's operated ever since the

817
01:07:24,51 --> 01:07:29,30
town manager act in.
Two thousand and four.

818
01:07:31,45 --> 01:07:35,80
May have cast some doubt about the authority
of the commission but then there was

819
01:07:35,81 --> 01:07:41,04
a subsequent special Act in two thousand
and ten that confirmed their authority as

820
01:07:41,08 --> 01:07:45,35
originally established in the one nine
hundred eighty six act and so that's how we

821
01:07:45,36 --> 01:07:50,56
were proceeding on least since I've been
around working on the district agreement

822
01:07:51,26 --> 01:07:55,20
and then I became aware of this tweak
if you will to the town manager act in

823
01:07:55,21 --> 01:08:01,02
December of two thousand and thirteen
which specifically cited the one thousand

824
01:08:01,03 --> 01:08:07,62
nine hundred six enabling authority of the
commission and and it seemed to. Almost

825
01:08:07,63 --> 01:08:11,83
know of by all the authority of the
commission with this new two thousand and

826
01:08:11,84 --> 01:08:17,51
thirteen act and when I mentioned it
to the director Roger Hill that I was

827
01:08:17,52 --> 01:08:23,33
surprised about of this recent amendment
and that I thought it now clouded all the

828
01:08:23,34 --> 01:08:28,98
authority that the commission had he said
no that's not what it was supposed to do

829
01:08:28,99 --> 01:08:33,43
it was supposed to just confirm at the time
at the time managers authority relative

830
01:08:33,44 --> 01:08:39,93
to personnel and collective bargaining
powers or on behalf of the town relative to

831
01:08:39,97 --> 01:08:45,34
water and sewer commission employees and
I said well because I was reviewing this

832
01:08:45,35 --> 01:08:50,05
in anticipation of that the commission may
be entertaining because that's always

833
01:08:50,06 --> 01:08:56,12
been the proposal relative to funding or.
Holding current rate payers harmless from

834
01:08:56,57 --> 01:09:01,27
the cost of the treatment plant improvements
that are coming down the pike if you

835
01:09:01,28 --> 01:09:06,51
will that we would gain this asset that
we could sell and so I was expecting

836
01:09:06,52 --> 01:09:11,25
anticipating that I would probably have to
issue an opinion or the commission would

837
01:09:11,26 --> 01:09:15,89
have to warrant represent in any transaction
that they are doing authorized to

838
01:09:15,90 --> 01:09:16,39
enter such

839
01:09:16,40 --> 01:09:20,91
a transaction and I And so when I saw this
two thousand and thirteen Amendment I

840
01:09:20,92 --> 01:09:21,22
said wait

841
01:09:21,23 --> 01:09:25,89
a minute this is our our authority now
is not so certain and as I said Mr Hill

842
01:09:25,93 --> 01:09:30,50
inform me that that was never the intention
and so with that I simply drafted what

843
01:09:30,51 --> 01:09:31,01
I thought was

844
01:09:31,02 --> 01:09:37,34
a relatively brief and non-controversial
clean up if you well to just confirm that

845
01:09:37,64 --> 01:09:41,56
what was adopted in two thousand and
thirteen did not intend to strip the

846
01:09:41,57 --> 01:09:46,79
commissioners of their authority relative
to. All sewer operations and ability to

847
01:09:46,80 --> 01:09:51,41
sell capacity that they certainly had from
the eighty six act and the two thousand

848
01:09:51,42 --> 01:09:53,91
and ten act and then it with

849
01:09:53,92 --> 01:09:58,14
a new town council very collegial
entertaining that I understood the board of

850
01:09:58,15 --> 01:10:03,41
selectmen were concerned about some they
wanted some oversight now learning perhaps

851
01:10:03,42 --> 01:10:06,70
that they may have gained some authority
that they didn't have previously with the

852
01:10:06,71 --> 01:10:08,84
thirteen I'm not I don't know if that's

853
01:10:08,88 --> 01:10:13,41
a fair characterization of it but the
commissioners strong opinion back to me was

854
01:10:13,73 --> 01:10:17,67
there was never any intention for the
Commission to give up its authority and that

855
01:10:18,47 --> 01:10:25,06
the thirteen Act should be clarified so as
I have with town council tried to broach

856
01:10:25,07 --> 01:10:29,37
the topic is there somewhere we could
go. And the answer has been pretty

857
01:10:29,38 --> 01:10:33,51
resoundingly no was never intended we
never intended to give anything up and

858
01:10:33,52 --> 01:10:39,17
therefore. They prefer my original proposal
to restore the status quo if you will

859
01:10:39,70 --> 01:10:44,50
so that's that's my kind of background as
to why we're here with relative to that

860
01:10:44,51 --> 01:10:49,85
article. But between the parties if
there's if there's anything that would be

861
01:10:49,86 --> 01:10:54,51
entertained of course I'd have to leave
it to the commissioners as to. Where they

862
01:10:54,52 --> 01:11:01,17
could go or what they could consider. This

863
01:11:01,50 --> 01:11:06,36
time. Around So turning that house and
I have spoken about this and we are in

864
01:11:06,37 --> 01:11:07,35
agreement that there is

865
01:11:07,36 --> 01:11:13,73
a legal way to do either of these of four
to clarify the authority either way or

866
01:11:13,98 --> 01:11:17,78
for the one way the board's both concluded
you want to go and we've come up with

867
01:11:17,79 --> 01:11:20,28
several different proposals
but it comes down to

868
01:11:20,29 --> 01:11:23,47
a policy decision that's that's not

869
01:11:23,88 --> 01:11:29,34
a legal decision we can help you. Which you
know with whatever language needs to go

870
01:11:29,35 --> 01:11:33,62
into one article to clarify and we agree
with his legal opinion previously that

871
01:11:33,63 --> 01:11:39,78
there was some. Marking of the waters if
you were with respect to the authority of

872
01:11:39,79 --> 01:11:43,97
the water and sewer commission by that
twenty thirteen Amendment so I think the

873
01:11:43,98 --> 01:11:47,75
boards do need to decide how they want
to handle this and then we can make the

874
01:11:47,76 --> 01:11:53,13
proper language exceptions to clarify the
previous special legislation for twenty

875
01:11:53,14 --> 01:11:58,88
thirteen through new special legislation
Thank you. Bill you mention one other

876
01:11:58,89 --> 01:12:04,47
aspect for us to discuss as we're working
on this recurring long and short term

877
01:12:04,48 --> 01:12:11,39
strategy. Right with respect to the long
or short term strategy I mean I was

878
01:12:11,40 --> 01:12:12,25
referring I think

879
01:12:12,26 --> 01:12:17,09
a lot of that was clarified the other
evening at least to my mind from the mini

880
01:12:17,10 --> 01:12:22,34
with the with the master plan discussion
that occurred just last week that there is

881
01:12:23,26 --> 01:12:29,38
a lot of capacity potentially here in the
in that the question is when is that

882
01:12:29,49 --> 01:12:34,60
they're going to come on line because
at the end of the day they the water so

883
01:12:34,61 --> 01:12:38,11
commission are primarily concerned with
making sure that that they're selling

884
01:12:38,12 --> 01:12:42,17
capacity and that capacity is going to be
able to pay for the for the for the new

885
01:12:42,18 --> 01:12:47,25
plant as it comes online and is Roger Hill
and I have discussed too that you know

886
01:12:47,26 --> 01:12:51,23
what he'd like to have some money that
could actually help bolster the fund the

887
01:12:51,24 --> 01:12:52,59
revolving fund there are

888
01:12:52,60 --> 01:12:56,80
a LOT him to do some additional I and I
work in the end to help pay for some of the

889
01:12:56,81 --> 01:13:01,05
other expenses associated with with providing
additional capacity into the system

890
01:13:01,90 --> 01:13:08,46
so having said that. The question that then
comes into mind are we going to. What's

891
01:13:08,47 --> 01:13:12,17
the best mechanism that we can have in place
where the both would feel comfortable

892
01:13:12,49 --> 01:13:17,50
that we're taking the right steps I think
it's very clear that there is that the

893
01:13:17,51 --> 01:13:22,39
goal of the little waters with which you
want the status quo retained but I think

894
01:13:22,40 --> 01:13:28,50
the remaining question is what's the level
of comfort that that the sale that that

895
01:13:28,51 --> 01:13:31,67
there is we've got in the sale of capacity
also are the boards committee will be

896
01:13:31,68 --> 01:13:35,25
fact we know based upon I mean it was
held this past week that there's

897
01:13:35,26 --> 01:13:40,12
a lot of potential for the Belmont right
within our own borders and is what is that

898
01:13:40,13 --> 01:13:46,46
Dubai is by selling their capacity outside
our borders those that in fact. Somehow

899
01:13:46,47 --> 01:13:50,30
jeopardize the future development of our
community that we go so that's really the

900
01:13:50,31 --> 01:13:55,51
question that we have to wrestle with you
is boards of policy makers is a really

901
01:13:55,52 --> 01:14:00,59
a policy decision we'll try to help you
get there but ultimately you have to give

902
01:14:00,60 --> 01:14:05,20
us guidance away one of those. Larry.

903
01:14:08,59 --> 01:14:15,51
Larry Thomas six Norton street private
citizen I'm just wondering why. So currently

904
01:14:15,52 --> 01:14:19,81
the way it is is anything outside the
district but in the town goes to town meeting

905
01:14:20,18 --> 01:14:24,51
why not have it so that anything outside
the steward district goes to town meeting

906
01:14:25,14 --> 01:14:25,93
whether it's at

907
01:14:25,94 --> 01:14:31,85
a town or in town and that that is the check
and balance I think that everybody is

908
01:14:31,86 --> 01:14:37,46
looking for so it doesn't come to the
select and but it goes to the town whether

909
01:14:37,47 --> 01:14:42,89
it's you know out of state not made out
of the town or in the town so are you

910
01:14:42,90 --> 01:14:43,56
saying that it was

911
01:14:43,57 --> 01:14:49,65
a project Saddam Hospital was when there
was so slow to that developer that that

912
01:14:49,66 --> 01:14:53,19
particular question we're going to find
Tommy Yes Yeah I mean I think I'm pretty

913
01:14:53,20 --> 01:14:56,92
sure that's what we that's what we passed
in the fall of two thousand and thirteen

914
01:14:57,46 --> 01:15:00,45
with that in anything outside the
sewer district whether it was

915
01:15:00,46 --> 01:15:01,46
a business or whether it was

916
01:15:01,47 --> 01:15:07,58
a private residence had to go to town
meeting. So I mean at that to tell you the

917
01:15:07,59 --> 01:15:12,22
truth at the time you know as an outcome
or when I voted for this I really thought

918
01:15:12,23 --> 01:15:18,95
that that also pertained to out of town
I didn't know that out of town was yet

919
01:15:18,99 --> 01:15:22,75
a third category you know
we have in District at

920
01:15:22,76 --> 01:15:28,76
a district in town out of district and
out of town that third category I never

921
01:15:28,77 --> 01:15:29,75
realized was

922
01:15:29,79 --> 01:15:34,85
a separate category so you. Want to look
which is limited only to the suit district

923
01:15:34,99 --> 01:15:39,74
Thank you yes yes and that's Yes I mean
you know the discussions that we had was

924
01:15:39,75 --> 01:15:40,47
that this was such

925
01:15:40,48 --> 01:15:45,59
a valuable asset to the town that the
town really should speak on how it's used

926
01:15:47,72 --> 01:15:52,07
thank you thank you. And you should.

927
01:15:54,94 --> 01:15:59,65
Say as as a selectman I was
intrigued by the I.M.F.

928
01:15:59,65 --> 01:16:06,57
. Process and I began attending water
meetings because I just wanted to learn

929
01:16:06,58 --> 01:16:11,70
what was going on what the I Am A was the
into municipal agreement you know so I

930
01:16:11,71 --> 01:16:18,52
tended on this two years I've been attending
meetings. And I I was very much for

931
01:16:18,53 --> 01:16:25,03
the the I Am Me it because I think that
the town deserves the ability to develop

932
01:16:25,04 --> 01:16:29,91
commercially and to help residential
residents who with failed such

933
01:16:29,92 --> 01:16:36,06
a septic system but I think the main
goal in my mind was for our economic

934
01:16:36,07 --> 01:16:41,47
development because right now the downtown
area where our fights Phil was are

935
01:16:41,74 --> 01:16:44,12
Bradley the old brothers posit the

936
01:16:44,13 --> 01:16:51,11
a limited in what can go in there
because of flow issues so for two

937
01:16:51,12 --> 01:16:56,76
years I've been I've been
listening in and. There were.

938
01:16:57,99 --> 01:17:04,87
Talks about. Sharon's comments and
the tally Sharon was mentioning.

939
01:17:05,89 --> 01:17:08,43
And I went to I was at

940
01:17:08,44 --> 01:17:14,40
a meeting and I and I there were two other
board members of another board were

941
01:17:14,41 --> 01:17:17,63
there and when Sharon can
sound to Sharon Clements as

942
01:17:17,64 --> 01:17:24,45
a possibility you know to sell flow the
three of us said you can't do that that's

943
01:17:24,46 --> 01:17:30,63
going out of town you're selling an asset
I've attempted before anybody in town has

944
01:17:31,30 --> 01:17:37,46
had the ability to purchase it. So
when these one articles came up

945
01:17:38,16 --> 01:17:43,67
I was assigned to do the to look into it
for from the boys like men because I'd

946
01:17:43,68 --> 01:17:47,99
been going to the waters were meeting so I
was familiar with it and as I read it I

947
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:54,84
realize that they. What was
housekeeping tweaking it to

948
01:17:54,85 --> 01:18:01,73
give the water and sewer. Authority
to do contracts you know executive

949
01:18:01,74 --> 01:18:08,19
authority situation to change all of
it I mean and this is the project of

950
01:18:08,19 --> 01:18:13,74
unintended consequences right right now
it's neverless whether water and sewer can

951
01:18:13,75 --> 01:18:13,86
do

952
01:18:13,88 --> 01:18:20,30
a conference. Right now according to the
attorney probably Bush workman has asked to

953
01:18:20,31 --> 01:18:27,14
have him so that's one problem
but then you have the idea here

954
01:18:27,15 --> 01:18:34,11
that the possibility of selling an asset
of the town sewage to it to another town

955
01:18:34,12 --> 01:18:40,52
to help them develop economically and for
the for housing and I said to myself Wait

956
01:18:40,87 --> 01:18:41,13
wait

957
01:18:41,14 --> 01:18:48,08
a minute this is this is something that
should be that should be looked at

958
01:18:48,09 --> 01:18:53,03
not. Because it's an asset not just
by the water and sewer but wait

959
01:18:53,04 --> 01:18:57,88
a minute maybe another thought he should
OK it are you know go along with that.

960
01:18:58,71 --> 01:19:02,38
Because when when the
I Am A was present at

961
01:19:02,39 --> 01:19:08,51
a town meeting and we except it the town
meeting was told that no one could look

962
01:19:08,52 --> 01:19:14,24
into the sewer system unless they got to
town meeting approval and that was very

963
01:19:14,25 --> 01:19:18,45
important because I don't believe that
the thing would have passed without that

964
01:19:18,46 --> 01:19:23,96
proviso that town meeting approval
had to be given in order to to.

965
01:19:26,08 --> 01:19:32,89
Go to with this become part of the source.
However nothing was said about oh by the

966
01:19:32,90 --> 01:19:38,87
way see I am a gives us one and
so are the authority to do

967
01:19:38,88 --> 01:19:45,49
a contract to sell sewage outside the town
without anybody's approval town meetings

968
01:19:45,53 --> 01:19:50,09
or going without anybody's
approval and I went Wait

969
01:19:50,10 --> 01:19:52,89
a minute that's that's

970
01:19:52,90 --> 01:19:58,74
a little different I think I
think we have to say it's take

971
01:19:58,75 --> 01:20:03,41
a step back and say what are we doing with
this very important asset of this town

972
01:20:04,63 --> 01:20:11,17
are we going to allow it to go out with to
be sold outside of town without somebody

973
01:20:11,18 --> 01:20:16,82
else saying yes that's OK or I don't think
so we don't want to do that so yes there

974
01:20:16,83 --> 01:20:23,72
are two issues there are two issues. And
I think in order I think both of the

975
01:20:23,73 --> 01:20:26,54
issues have to be have to we have to have

976
01:20:26,55 --> 01:20:32,41
a solution to both the issues before we go
to town meeting. Because I won't support

977
01:20:33,21 --> 01:20:38,54
that one out of vote unless there
is some mechanism that gives

978
01:20:39,25 --> 01:20:45,85
a check another check on some
possible sale of flow outside of town

979
01:20:46,51 --> 01:20:51,29
you have town meeting history prove
inside towns Well I think this should be

980
01:20:51,30 --> 01:20:56,96
something as Larry said he the town meeting
our sound check for selling it outside

981
01:20:56,97 --> 01:21:01,36
town because it's an asset to the
town it's been characterized as

982
01:21:01,37 --> 01:21:06,47
a liability at five point five million
dollars liability Well yes we own five point

983
01:21:06,48 --> 01:21:11,47
five million dollars but we don't know
what on Thursday we don't start paying it

984
01:21:11,48 --> 01:21:12,08
for

985
01:21:12,09 --> 01:21:18,06
a few years and Randy has explained that
it is doable even if we don't so all the

986
01:21:18,07 --> 01:21:25,03
flow right away it is doable town can
handle it I think I'm afraid that that

987
01:21:25,04 --> 01:21:31,21
the the impetus to sell flown in order to
protect the town and I understand water

988
01:21:31,22 --> 01:21:37,92
and sewer is concerned about about the money
I understand that but what I'm saying

989
01:21:37,93 --> 01:21:39,06
is wait

990
01:21:39,07 --> 01:21:45,20
a minute let's wait to see if the people
are into these inside town want to buy

991
01:21:45,21 --> 01:21:50,23
this because the number one hundred twenty
five thousand gallons has been bandied

992
01:21:50,24 --> 01:21:56,45
about in more from one of the one place.
If we if we have one hundred seventy five

993
01:21:56,46 --> 01:22:00,95
thousand gallons that we have we have
purchased from Mansfield and you deduct that

994
01:22:00,96 --> 01:22:06,42
hundred twenty five thousand gallons from
that you have fifty thousand gallons.

995
01:22:07,76 --> 01:22:12,72
With fifty thousand gallons if you will if
you if you if you want to develop spill

996
01:22:12,73 --> 01:22:13,41
clouds or

997
01:22:13,42 --> 01:22:18,09
a breath these plans are are we have if
we have come in and that's only fifty

998
01:22:18,13 --> 01:22:24,92
thousand so that was that was
my concern. My concern is is

999
01:22:25,08 --> 01:22:26,64
we should have a check as we have

1000
01:22:26,65 --> 01:22:33,59
a check and balance for for adding for
going into the system inside town but

1001
01:22:33,60 --> 01:22:34,18
then we should have

1002
01:22:34,19 --> 01:22:39,34
a check and balance of the product possibility
of selling fall outside the town so

1003
01:22:39,35 --> 01:22:44,53
this is two different issues in the end I
understand that but I would but like I

1004
01:22:44,54 --> 01:22:51,15
said I would not support that the war in
Iraq and tweaking unless we have like

1005
01:22:51,16 --> 01:22:56,72
a side letter or an agreement or
something that that there would be

1006
01:22:56,73 --> 01:23:02,86
a check and balance on possible
outside town sale or they. Can.

1007
01:23:06,41 --> 01:23:12,62
Share from. Your own life of
forty three grants really

1008
01:23:13,52 --> 01:23:18,99
just to in order to address some of the
Lowry said first of all just as an aside

1009
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:21,66
here that the two potential forty B.

1010
01:23:21,84 --> 01:23:26,96
That are on the docket now one that's
already been filed and the second one which

1011
01:23:26,97 --> 01:23:33,40
was just filed today those alone will
be the large one if it was to pass the

1012
01:23:33,41 --> 01:23:33,98
C.B.S.

1013
01:23:33,99 --> 01:23:39,77
Authority at Fisher Street is just slightly
under forty eight thousand gallons it's

1014
01:23:39,78 --> 01:23:40,45
about a million

1015
01:23:40,46 --> 01:23:44,90
a right there and then Mr Lynch is and
he's Foxboro has about thirty five hundred

1016
01:23:44,91 --> 01:23:49,19
gallons so between the two of them it's
over two million dollars You know right off

1017
01:23:49,23 --> 01:23:54,73
right off the bat to address any concerns
about how do we begin to make payments I

1018
01:23:54,74 --> 01:24:00,19
don't think Andy Randy would ever have to
make the loan you know to get us to get

1019
01:24:00,20 --> 01:24:04,36
a started. My concern with what would with

1020
01:24:04,37 --> 01:24:10,56
a lot reset is you know in terms of the
economic growth picture for the town of

1021
01:24:10,57 --> 01:24:16,18
Foxborough or any town today. As if the F
A project of any size wants to come to

1022
01:24:16,19 --> 01:24:20,54
your town they want to know want to advance
what their potential is they don't want

1023
01:24:20,55 --> 01:24:24,42
to know that it could be hanging in the
balance of town meeting which we all know

1024
01:24:24,69 --> 01:24:27,37
can be a very it's a great form
of government but it can be

1025
01:24:27,38 --> 01:24:31,10
a very fickle form of government as well
it's very difficult to get two or three or

1026
01:24:31,11 --> 01:24:34,21
five hundred people to all
agree that that plaza is

1027
01:24:34,22 --> 01:24:38,13
a terrific idea or that new
biological buildings going to be

1028
01:24:38,14 --> 01:24:43,73
a great idea wherever it might be so you
know I'd be more inclined I just as

1029
01:24:43,74 --> 01:24:44,59
a citizen I'd be

1030
01:24:44,60 --> 01:24:48,27
a lot happier if I knew that there was an
arrangement in that particular kind of

1031
01:24:48,28 --> 01:24:54,79
case between the wars commissioners and the
executive branch or whatever where it's

1032
01:24:54,80 --> 01:24:56,09
more finite group that can make

1033
01:24:56,10 --> 01:25:00,33
a decision about the economic future of our
town instead of you know just laying it

1034
01:25:00,34 --> 01:25:04,82
out there and waiting for an annual meeting
or I September or November or January

1035
01:25:04,83 --> 01:25:09,45
me whenever it's going to come because I
think that you may miss opportunities for

1036
01:25:09,46 --> 01:25:15,66
economic development if we if we work
on that basis thank you thank you.

1037
01:25:18,29 --> 01:25:25,28
Very. Very Weinstein one twelve
South High Street I'm reading.

1038
01:25:26,53 --> 01:25:33,02
Mr Hill's. Letter to the Foxboro patch of
October eighteenth of twenty thirteen he

1039
01:25:33,03 --> 01:25:38,71
explains to the people of Foxboro why we
should be entering into the I Am A All of

1040
01:25:38,72 --> 01:25:45,60
the. Explanations given involve.
Dealing with issues in town

1041
01:25:46,07 --> 01:25:52,85
none of them involve selling flow out
of town. I would say that I agree

1042
01:25:52,86 --> 01:25:58,08
with this cupolas. Point that the there
should be some checks and balances

1043
01:25:58,20 --> 01:26:02,99
regarding the sale of flow outside of town
but I would say that should also include

1044
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:04,13
a sale

1045
01:26:04,14 --> 01:26:08,77
a flow outside of the district. Gentleman
from the Planning Board just said that.

1046
01:26:09,89 --> 01:26:13,16
People want to know ahead
of coming in to make

1047
01:26:13,17 --> 01:26:16,97
a bid on building something in town whether
or not they're going to get that flow I

1048
01:26:16,98 --> 01:26:20,71
would say that the the handover group
already knew well before we'd even entered

1049
01:26:20,72 --> 01:26:24,27
into the I Am A from the water and
sewer commissioner and from the D.P.W.

1050
01:26:24,28 --> 01:26:26,84
Chief that they were going
to get that flow it was

1051
01:26:26,85 --> 01:26:33,22
a parcel of land that was excluded so.
You're not going to lie you seem to do an

1052
01:26:33,23 --> 01:26:36,91
awful lot well I mean we don't we don't
want to we want to break this not we'll get

1053
01:26:36,92 --> 01:26:40,70
Will you leave it up to respond but I will
be going to I don't know how they would

1054
01:26:40,71 --> 01:26:44,50
think that they were going to build five
four storey buildings in that development

1055
01:26:45,26 --> 01:26:51,19
without the knowledge of being able to
get flow seeing as the extended stay was

1056
01:26:51,23 --> 01:26:55,16
limited to ten thousand gallons
of septic and flow wasn't even

1057
01:26:55,17 --> 01:27:00,19
a possibility there because that wasn't
part of the district it seems possibly that

1058
01:27:00,20 --> 01:27:04,85
the I am a map has been altered to change
it so that it says that if it's a forty B.

1059
01:27:04,86 --> 01:27:08,81
Somehow it's now in the district even though
the I may maps that it was not part of

1060
01:27:08,82 --> 01:27:14,67
the district representative Barrows knew
about this proposal two years ago before

1061
01:27:14,68 --> 01:27:17,02
we entered into the I may
or even discuss the I am

1062
01:27:17,03 --> 01:27:23,05
a. There's been at least three different
explanations on different occasions by

1063
01:27:23,06 --> 01:27:24,43
water and sewer and D.P.W.

1064
01:27:24,44 --> 01:27:27,67
As to what the flow capacity in the
source of the flow are meetings that I've

1065
01:27:27,68 --> 01:27:34,47
attended. It seems to me that
this this development on

1066
01:27:34,48 --> 01:27:35,82
Fisher street is very much

1067
01:27:35,83 --> 01:27:42,21
a big part of the concern
here. I'm sure my stand said

1068
01:27:42,95 --> 01:27:43,19
in

1069
01:27:43,20 --> 01:27:46,97
a personal conversation with one of our
neighbors and I'm paraphrasing here why are

1070
01:27:46,98 --> 01:27:48,10
you people fighting this it's

1071
01:27:48,11 --> 01:27:53,49
a done deal he emailed on January
twenty first in response to.

1072
01:27:54,63 --> 01:27:58,74
Visitation to meet in the January twenty
seventh meeting held to clarify the water

1073
01:27:58,75 --> 01:28:01,78
and sewer issues at Town Hall and
I'm quoting directly here this is

1074
01:28:01,79 --> 01:28:05,86
a group of aggrieved to butters using every
irrelevant argument they can come up

1075
01:28:05,87 --> 01:28:06,95
with to stop a forty B.

1076
01:28:06,96 --> 01:28:11,41
Housing project I'm not playing this useless
and unproductive game Thank you let me

1077
01:28:11,42 --> 01:28:11,89
give you all

1078
01:28:11,90 --> 01:28:15,96
a nickel's worth of advice can see that
this is going to be built so I would say

1079
01:28:15,97 --> 01:28:18,94
that it sure does seem like people already
do know what they're going to be given

1080
01:28:18,95 --> 01:28:24,96
here and that's deeply concerning to me and
still wants to. Test yet he is you know

1081
01:28:24,97 --> 01:28:29,90
just like this I appreciate your comments
but this is really not relevant to this

1082
01:28:29,95 --> 01:28:32,36
particular discussion I think
it is because I think as

1083
01:28:32,37 --> 01:28:35,81
a resident of the community I understand
I would like to see some checks and

1084
01:28:35,82 --> 01:28:37,100
balances oids the OK that's that's

1085
01:28:38,01 --> 01:28:42,02
a fair point OK but I think and this is
what I would like when we joke but we don't

1086
01:28:42,03 --> 01:28:43,86
want to get into a
discussion about a forty B.

1087
01:28:43,87 --> 01:28:45,40
Prog specific as that's

1088
01:28:45,41 --> 01:28:48,90
a different forum for different discussion
on that night so I'm bringing that up he

1089
01:28:48,91 --> 01:28:53,84
has an example of why I believe that
that checks and balance needs to happen

1090
01:28:53,85 --> 01:28:59,30
because I believe that perhaps the authority
has been overstepped for an OK Thank

1091
01:28:59,31 --> 01:29:04,07
you. So I think it's appropriate to look
at the what is what the issue is was about

1092
01:29:04,17 --> 01:29:09,46
a couple points of clarification if I may
for the chair the I. Was in the I Am A

1093
01:29:09,47 --> 01:29:13,62
that vested in the sewer commissioners
water and sewer commissioners with the

1094
01:29:13,63 --> 01:29:20,17
authority or ability to sell capacity in
the treatment plan that they were at one

1095
01:29:20,18 --> 01:29:21,49
time a contract a party now

1096
01:29:21,50 --> 01:29:25,94
a member of the district it was the one
thousand nine hundred six Act and the two

1097
01:29:25,95 --> 01:29:32,53
thousand and ten special Act that gave
them out of card. The. Each misspoke

1098
01:29:32,54 --> 01:29:37,90
remember the district agreement didn't take
it away. In it didn't interfere with it

1099
01:29:37,99 --> 01:29:41,69
it's consistent with the authority they
had it was the two thousand and thirteen

1100
01:29:41,70 --> 01:29:48,05
amendment that put the cloud over all of
the authority the sort of measures and

1101
01:29:48,06 --> 01:29:52,22
then relative to forty votes in the two
thousand and ten special act that they are

1102
01:29:52,23 --> 01:29:57,44
not subject to the district requirement so
it came with the legislation that those

1103
01:29:57,45 --> 01:29:59,95
uses didn't work required to be in

1104
01:29:59,96 --> 01:30:06,04
a store district as approved by town meeting
to be entitled to store service so it

1105
01:30:06,05 --> 01:30:08,73
wasn't something in the I.M.A.

1106
01:30:08,77 --> 01:30:13,74
Or the district agreement that exempted
those it was in the legislation Thank you.

1107
01:30:16,38 --> 01:30:22,40
It may say something. Going
back to what Jenny had said

1108
01:30:23,24 --> 01:30:27,18
and again everything I listen to and
at the expense of sounding like

1109
01:30:27,19 --> 01:30:33,69
a broken record. The warrant in the issue
at hand is authority over all authority

1110
01:30:33,70 --> 01:30:39,61
of the water and sewer commission. In which
we just keep very away from that and in

1111
01:30:39,73 --> 01:30:45,47
to what Jenny said about she would not
support the article. If something isn't done

1112
01:30:45,48 --> 01:30:52,47
about it which we're taking one instance
which I don't necessarily agree or

1113
01:30:52,48 --> 01:30:56,17
disagree with every comment that's
made here you know it's it's

1114
01:30:56,18 --> 01:31:01,74
a good conversation that should be had
personally I think it's the wrong time but

1115
01:31:03,86 --> 01:31:09,83
we're introducing that as if it's part
of this article to the general public we

1116
01:31:09,84 --> 01:31:12,10
have people talking about
sewer and forty B.

1117
01:31:12,84 --> 01:31:18,30
The article was about the authority of the
water and sewer commission and you know

1118
01:31:18,36 --> 01:31:21,89
you had mentioned you wouldn't support it
so essentially if that doesn't get done

1119
01:31:21,93 --> 01:31:27,54
you're you're not supporting you're.
Telling the public you not supporting the

1120
01:31:27,55 --> 01:31:32,30
water and sewer commission having authority
to do any basically do what we were

1121
01:31:32,31 --> 01:31:38,94
voted to sit in and do. Well I think if
you listen to Bill's opening statement I

1122
01:31:38,95 --> 01:31:44,66
think we are not trying to do that try OK
But when but when she says that she won't

1123
01:31:44,67 --> 01:31:50,48
support it and that's that's that's my
issue with it is is it's the the public

1124
01:31:50,49 --> 01:31:50,99
probably has

1125
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:57,48
a right to act on whether we have the IT
sole authority whether combined we have

1126
01:31:57,49 --> 01:32:01,50
the authority whether to go to town meeting
but isn't that important afterwards I

1127
01:32:01,51 --> 01:32:05,51
don't want to mourn article.
Trying to do is sure to hammer out

1128
01:32:05,52 --> 01:32:10,19
a mechanism where you guys have for forty
to handle day to day activities with one

1129
01:32:10,20 --> 01:32:16,78
of us who just report comes to long term
strategic. Actions that there is there's

1130
01:32:16,79 --> 01:32:20,18
a check in basically we get together and
we say does this make sense for the future

1131
01:32:20,19 --> 01:32:24,14
of the Tao I think that's where would we
were trying to get to but what with all

1132
01:32:24,15 --> 01:32:30,21
the conversation that's been had here I
don't know that the public at home is truly

1133
01:32:30,22 --> 01:32:36,35
understanding what's at stake and when
it said that we won't support it over so

1134
01:32:36,64 --> 01:32:39,36
over to sewer capacity who
has the authority to sell so

1135
01:32:39,37 --> 01:32:45,25
a capacity. I think most people are
understanding that as that's what it pertains

1136
01:32:45,26 --> 01:32:50,23
to one ever really doesn't pertain to
all authority and that's why you know

1137
01:32:50,24 --> 01:32:55,20
personally you know these these two issues
really need to be separated and people

1138
01:32:55,21 --> 01:32:56,62
need to prop up you know be

1139
01:32:56,63 --> 01:33:03,08
a bit of vote properly understand one is
complete authority and the other is who

1140
01:33:03,09 --> 01:33:07,37
has authority to do you know one particular
thing on manage one particular is I

1141
01:33:07,38 --> 01:33:12,90
think is I heard this I heard. It was
compose comments and she said that she

1142
01:33:12,91 --> 01:33:13,91
couldn't support without

1143
01:33:13,92 --> 01:33:19,17
a mechanism OK So I think that's the key
key language here is that they have that

1144
01:33:19,18 --> 01:33:21,36
you could support it provided
there's a mechanism for

1145
01:33:21,37 --> 01:33:25,76
a check and balance and so the question
really is what's the level of comfort that

1146
01:33:25,77 --> 01:33:29,87
everyone has here tonight as to what that
mechanism is and I don't know what the

1147
01:33:29,88 --> 01:33:34,97
mechanism is and I think I really have to
to turn to the legal minds here to figure

1148
01:33:34,98 --> 01:33:37,91
that out because I don't know what that
legally can be done if there is there

1149
01:33:37,92 --> 01:33:39,46
a binding mechanism that can be

1150
01:33:39,47 --> 01:33:43,80
a site separate it aside from the the
action that's it here that gives people

1151
01:33:43,84 --> 01:33:47,50
a level of comfort that we can go forward
from here but doesn't that doesn't the

1152
01:33:47,51 --> 01:33:47,98
public have

1153
01:33:47,99 --> 01:33:52,64
a right to weigh in on that as well and but
by combining these we're asking them to

1154
01:33:52,65 --> 01:33:57,63
weigh in. I think the people behind the
discussion tonight is what's really what is

1155
01:33:57,64 --> 01:34:01,49
the what is the right mechanism to support
to get to the to your point that you

1156
01:34:01,50 --> 01:34:06,54
want to be tested and I don't know what
that is. I understand your point but with

1157
01:34:07,27 --> 01:34:08,43
Oh so you know I can make

1158
01:34:08,44 --> 01:34:12,85
a suggestion or I think Steve is going
to mix it just what I was just listening

1159
01:34:12,86 --> 01:34:16,74
a little bit is the commission it was
one. Proposal floated perhaps of

1160
01:34:16,75 --> 01:34:21,07
a side ladder where if that one article
was advancing then maybe the side letter

1161
01:34:21,08 --> 01:34:26,58
could. Be that mechanism of whatever the
terms would be whether it be notice to the

1162
01:34:26,59 --> 01:34:27,40
Board of Selectmen of

1163
01:34:27,41 --> 01:34:31,52
a proposal and the dates that the commissioners
would be considering that and then

1164
01:34:31,53 --> 01:34:38,24
members of this like Board could attend.
Just this so that's one form of

1165
01:34:38,73 --> 01:34:44,82
means for. Would that be with that type
of agreement be binding in terms of the

1166
01:34:44,83 --> 01:34:51,66
fact that there would be. Any type of
proposal like that to sell outside of the

1167
01:34:51,67 --> 01:34:57,42
town would involve the opinion of both
boards working together to come with

1168
01:34:57,43 --> 01:34:59,05
a majority but

1169
01:34:59,06 --> 01:35:03,44
a proof that time was that see that so
that that's the crux of it isn't it I mean

1170
01:35:03,45 --> 01:35:08,20
what what this proposal was was notice so
that you'd be aware and then you could

1171
01:35:08,21 --> 01:35:12,33
have time then and address your concerns
something more than not I don't know if

1172
01:35:12,34 --> 01:35:17,15
the commissioners are willing
to concede that I mean

1173
01:35:17,16 --> 01:35:23,19
a lot of them. Michael Christian.

1174
01:35:25,61 --> 01:35:30,85
With that is. That just giving notice of

1175
01:35:30,86 --> 01:35:37,56
a possible sale outside town. Has

1176
01:35:37,57 --> 01:35:44,08
no. It's unilateral whereas
if the situation was selling

1177
01:35:44,90 --> 01:35:48,67
inside time in within the
borders you would have to have

1178
01:35:48,71 --> 01:35:55,25
a town meeting approval there was an
expectation by the public that they would have

1179
01:35:55,26 --> 01:36:02,17
a say in how the sewage was sold in you
and that was one in that I believe that

1180
01:36:02,18 --> 01:36:08,99
was the only reason that town meeting
approved it and so why would you think that

1181
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:15,73
town meeting would want to prove inside
the borders but they wouldn't have the

1182
01:36:15,74 --> 01:36:21,27
saying that what that they would think would
be OK just to sell outside the borders

1183
01:36:21,82 --> 01:36:23,16
in order to help

1184
01:36:24,01 --> 01:36:29,89
a neighboring community develop
economically and develop the housing.

1185
01:36:30,93 --> 01:36:35,55
Why would why would you think the average
person but growth would think that was OK

1186
01:36:35,55 --> 01:36:41,60
. I don't think that's OK And so
what I would what I would say and.

1187
01:36:42,75 --> 01:36:47,04
What I will say is work out work
out something when there is

1188
01:36:47,05 --> 01:36:53,58
a check and check and balance on the scale
outside just the same way. There is that

1189
01:36:54,20 --> 01:37:01,13
family size. And it would have to be that
would have to be worked out before town

1190
01:37:01,14 --> 01:37:03,26
meeting so that there is

1191
01:37:03,27 --> 01:37:09,64
a guarantee that that process is in
place or that your wiring is considered

1192
01:37:09,65 --> 01:37:14,58
a town. That's you need two parties
to switch agreement right so I mean.

1193
01:37:18,24 --> 01:37:23,09
The commissioners always had the bizzare
to sell outside of the town without time

1194
01:37:23,10 --> 01:37:28,99
meeting under those the legislation but you
know what. Anybody say that did anybody

1195
01:37:29,70 --> 01:37:35,71
tell me when they were. When you know when
this was but before tell me did anybody

1196
01:37:35,72 --> 01:37:40,75
say Did anybody did any of the water
commission say listen oh by the way what if

1197
01:37:40,76 --> 01:37:45,15
you want to hook up inside town we need
anything approval by the way if we want to

1198
01:37:45,16 --> 01:37:50,25
sell it to another town we can do it we
don't need anybody over there anybody I

1199
01:37:50,26 --> 01:37:54,63
don't think so well I know in the den as
to you know we've got this unique special

1200
01:37:54,64 --> 01:37:57,77
Act that allows the town to a staff
with the most times when you have

1201
01:37:57,78 --> 01:38:02,80
a public works department or water and
sewer the entire geography of the town is

1202
01:38:02,81 --> 01:38:04,18
the district we've got

1203
01:38:04,19 --> 01:38:08,78
a unique Act that allows us to create
districts within the town to it makes sense

1204
01:38:08,79 --> 01:38:12,77
to me that to make expand or alter those
districts within the time you can bring

1205
01:38:12,81 --> 01:38:18,76
you bring it to Tommy. But the just outside
center was always available under the

1206
01:38:18,97 --> 01:38:25,53
legislation from eighty
six. Excuse me. But.

1207
01:38:26,63 --> 01:38:33,46
Where oh just so you know yes it was
ninety days yes I was in there did not

1208
01:38:33,47 --> 01:38:38,52
go over there to tell you Jack you ask
anybody you were doing more street had the

1209
01:38:38,53 --> 01:38:44,45
pranks running right. Now and
more street could not work in

1210
01:38:45,27 --> 01:38:49,31
excuse might I was one with them so it
was what's unique about the town meeting

1211
01:38:49,32 --> 01:38:53,03
approved was because we have these
Internet town districts that's so unusual

1212
01:38:53,99 --> 01:38:57,76
otherwise you know the whole town would be
the district and maybe so it wouldn't be

1213
01:38:57,77 --> 01:39:04,55
before excuse me I just want our
attorney to speak. Well if you have

1214
01:39:04,56 --> 01:39:07,51
a specific question I'm happy to answer
that but the comment I wanted to make was

1215
01:39:07,52 --> 01:39:09,35
just that again this comes back to

1216
01:39:09,36 --> 01:39:13,06
a policy decision the both both of these
boards and whoever else wants to be

1217
01:39:13,07 --> 01:39:16,86
involved I think it's just these two have
to come to an agreement we can certainly

1218
01:39:17,07 --> 01:39:21,30
come up with any language that meets your
desires the most recent proposal I just

1219
01:39:21,31 --> 01:39:26,96
heard was notice and an opportunity to
be to participate in the hearings which

1220
01:39:26,97 --> 01:39:30,64
that's fine but that's not going to address
approval of already that's just an

1221
01:39:30,65 --> 01:39:36,59
opportunity to be involved in the discussion
somehow and if that may not be enough

1222
01:39:36,60 --> 01:39:41,23
for the Board of Selectmen another
opportunity that you might want to consider

1223
01:39:41,55 --> 01:39:46,40
maybe opportunity isn't the right word but
another potential language change. If

1224
01:39:46,41 --> 01:39:49,76
this is acceptable to the Board of Selectmen
might be acceptable to the water and

1225
01:39:49,77 --> 01:39:54,52
sewer commissioners as the language that
in the article that's proposing to give

1226
01:39:54,53 --> 01:39:58,37
the board of selectmen final approval of
four eighty or whatever terminology you

1227
01:39:58,38 --> 01:40:02,90
want to be use that involves something
more more than just directory you know

1228
01:40:02,91 --> 01:40:06,29
something that's mandatory.
What about considering

1229
01:40:06,30 --> 01:40:12,62
a capacity limit whereby the Board of
Selectmen. Gets the final approval authority

1230
01:40:12,70 --> 01:40:17,24
if the amount of water and sewer
that sold outside of town is over

1231
01:40:17,25 --> 01:40:21,07
a certain capacity I have no idea what that
capacity would be but that's something

1232
01:40:21,08 --> 01:40:27,95
that you might want to consider
amongst the two boards. Any

1233
01:40:27,96 --> 01:40:31,96
thoughts on that and obviously anything
under that capacity the water and sewer

1234
01:40:31,97 --> 01:40:35,94
just takes care of it themselves and
this like we don't have any involvement

1235
01:40:35,95 --> 01:40:42,18
approval authority that
might make. Both sides. Of

1236
01:40:42,19 --> 01:40:47,48
a complication think we can get to the
point where we can do fine so. Let's go to

1237
01:40:47,49 --> 01:40:51,32
town meeting. Join us.

1238
01:40:55,73 --> 01:41:01,71
Well that the language
the first. Response of.

1239
01:41:06,56 --> 01:41:08,42
The language has been made

1240
01:41:08,43 --> 01:41:11,90
a little murky though so it
does have to be clarified so.

1241
01:41:15,62 --> 01:41:20,99
The language has been right but also there's
another issue there's another issue

1242
01:41:21,34 --> 01:41:26,79
check and balance about selling an asset
this is an asset of the town this is worth

1243
01:41:26,80 --> 01:41:33,14
understanding this is this is this is
important to the degree of the of the town

1244
01:41:33,52 --> 01:41:40,38
that's why town. Approved it with
the expectation that this was going

1245
01:41:40,46 --> 01:41:47,45
to be used for the development of the
town. The economic not the economic

1246
01:41:47,46 --> 01:41:52,36
development of the neighboring community
which would boost their economic base body

1247
01:41:52,37 --> 01:41:58,75
to fifty percent in housing only it would
put them over the ten percent why should

1248
01:41:58,76 --> 01:42:03,57
the town of Foxborough right out
of the game region without without

1249
01:42:03,61 --> 01:42:10,53
a marketing flow to entities in town
in tights people bring Why should we

1250
01:42:10,57 --> 01:42:15,60
give them water so the ability to see to
sell that asset that we have been waiting

1251
01:42:15,61 --> 01:42:21,06
for you is to have if I may go through
you Madam Chair That's why I drafted

1252
01:42:21,07 --> 01:42:24,74
a war an article that gave the board of
selectmen that final approval of the

1253
01:42:24,75 --> 01:42:30,24
already but the water ensure commissioners
are not happy with it so and so we're

1254
01:42:30,25 --> 01:42:36,90
still at an impasse so this overage you
know I think you know there's total

1255
01:42:36,91 --> 01:42:41,57
support that all already should be read
all three should be returned as was

1256
01:42:41,61 --> 01:42:45,56
originally intended. I think
what we have here is we're in

1257
01:42:45,57 --> 01:42:47,06
a new place we have like

1258
01:42:47,10 --> 01:42:52,98
a master plan that has evolved over the
past couple of years that. The citizens are

1259
01:42:52,99 --> 01:42:56,88
saying that they want their commercial tax
base to grow from Route one it's kind of

1260
01:42:56,89 --> 01:43:01,59
a different direction from you know the
concept of selling outside of town and I

1261
01:43:01,60 --> 01:43:07,12
think that's where you know this is
coming from it's not I really believe one

1262
01:43:07,12 --> 01:43:13,88
hundred percent that involving
the board of selectmen in

1263
01:43:13,89 --> 01:43:19,37
a joint decision making process with the
water and sewer commissioners is just

1264
01:43:20,56 --> 01:43:27,02
a different way of doing business in because
of this evolution and so I think it

1265
01:43:27,10 --> 01:43:27,61
it's

1266
01:43:27,65 --> 01:43:34,69
a sensible approach it
doesn't step it does put the

1267
01:43:34,70 --> 01:43:35,63
board of selectmen in

1268
01:43:35,64 --> 01:43:41,27
a place that they never were before
I understand that but I think that

1269
01:43:42,79 --> 01:43:47,68
we're in a different place and this
is an opportunity that. If we just do

1270
01:43:47,87 --> 01:43:53,40
a slight adjustment of our course in the
same way that the master plan has adjusted

1271
01:43:53,41 --> 01:43:59,80
its course you know the course of what
people are asking for in the town. I think

1272
01:43:59,81 --> 01:44:06,69
it can all be addressed in one
fell swoop you know. It's really.

1273
01:44:07,73 --> 01:44:13,29
I know it's not simple but it's just it's
a change that's happened over time in

1274
01:44:13,30 --> 01:44:18,69
a very short time and I think we're positioned
right now to do the right thing for

1275
01:44:18,86 --> 01:44:23,71
everybody by you know having this type of
consensus between the two boards for such

1276
01:44:23,72 --> 01:44:30,63
an important asset I don't think
we disagree I think our issue is

1277
01:44:30,64 --> 01:44:36,19
it doesn't belong in this war an article
but if it can and I think the attorneys I

1278
01:44:36,20 --> 01:44:40,86
believe then if we really can't both here
then we'll both elected boards and the

1279
01:44:40,87 --> 01:44:43,14
general public as much as us has

1280
01:44:43,15 --> 01:44:47,76
a right to weigh in on this but we're
asking him to weigh in on it now by the way

1281
01:44:47,77 --> 01:44:52,56
this this caviar that old if you if you
don't decide to go along with it it's going

1282
01:44:52,57 --> 01:44:59,44
to relinquish all the authority so don't
we owe them to clean this up put it

1283
01:44:59,45 --> 01:45:03,42
back to where it was meant to
be and then write a war not

1284
01:45:03,43 --> 01:45:09,13
a co-op or get together unilaterally and
devise something where the public can

1285
01:45:09,14 --> 01:45:13,27
weigh in on in states soley
on the merit of selling to

1286
01:45:13,28 --> 01:45:15,04
a capacity whether be inside

1287
01:45:15,05 --> 01:45:19,85
a town outside of town how about wherever
the conversation goes I don't think any

1288
01:45:19,86 --> 01:45:25,41
of us here disagree with that I just don't
think it's it's where we're playing with

1289
01:45:25,42 --> 01:45:29,05
this is the already well most harsh trading
with this authority that was never

1290
01:45:29,06 --> 01:45:35,46
meant to be where it is let's put it back
to where it was originally intended to go

1291
01:45:35,79 --> 01:45:41,32
and then get together and figure out how
to clean up the other issue because we

1292
01:45:41,33 --> 01:45:46,34
don't disagree that that's more you know
warrants conversation and definitely wants

1293
01:45:46,34 --> 01:45:51,97
. I think if I just say it's a couple
whites I I think we're just all

1294
01:45:51,98 --> 01:45:55,50
a cop in this discussion we don't need this
and I don't think anybody here is doing

1295
01:45:55,51 --> 01:46:00,26
it intentionally I think but it's clearly
quite simple it's come down to one piece

1296
01:46:00,27 --> 01:46:04,61
of this authority that's it it's that
it's the question of whether or not any

1297
01:46:04,62 --> 01:46:07,78
capacity should be sold outside the borders
of this community should that have

1298
01:46:07,79 --> 01:46:12,09
a secondary approval process and that's
it and the only opportunity to really do

1299
01:46:12,10 --> 01:46:17,11
that is with this amendment back in two to
restore the authority because right now

1300
01:46:17,12 --> 01:46:22,24
the authority rests we think rests with
this one so the question then becomes this

1301
01:46:22,30 --> 01:46:25,79
is I understand this was willing to
relinquish all authority back to your boy

1302
01:46:26,20 --> 01:46:31,36
without question except for that one issue
and that and it's really an important

1303
01:46:31,37 --> 01:46:36,58
policy consideration because if we don't
address it now there will be no mechanism

1304
01:46:36,59 --> 01:46:41,43
that will later other than to say OK
let's have an agreement to have to have

1305
01:46:41,44 --> 01:46:45,64
a hearing where people can tend but their
youth already still rest back with fully

1306
01:46:45,65 --> 01:46:50,11
rest back with the boy but what the waters
will commission so that's what the end

1307
01:46:50,12 --> 01:46:55,03
of the day I think that's really where the
level of comfort has to be resolved is

1308
01:46:55,07 --> 01:47:00,01
is that something that that everyone here
is comfortable with and so far I haven't

1309
01:47:00,02 --> 01:47:03,95
heard that this full agreement so I think
we need to come to some resolution of

1310
01:47:03,95 --> 01:47:08,12
that and I don't think anybody here is
willing to take is we as expressed any

1311
01:47:08,13 --> 01:47:11,45
interest in taking the authority away from
it from the commission I think they're

1312
01:47:11,47 --> 01:47:16,39
actually fairly thought of very it's one
of them just what I want aspect somebody.

1313
01:47:23,10 --> 01:47:29,79
On just to say Neal Kaiser of love
individual. You know Wing right now.

1314
01:47:31,15 --> 01:47:31,79
Scuse me

1315
01:47:33,75 --> 01:47:39,21
a few years back I said I
support the water and so

1316
01:47:39,22 --> 01:47:45,02
a commission I always have they they always
did an excellent job in this town and

1317
01:47:46,27 --> 01:47:51,50
they had many many different awards and
everything else over the last few years. I

1318
01:47:51,51 --> 01:47:58,05
got upset with the vote that was taking
by the water and sewer to relinquish

1319
01:47:58,06 --> 01:48:04,54
power and now I'm hearing that they want
it back maybe I'm wrong in understanding

1320
01:48:04,55 --> 01:48:09,06
what's going on here I went to

1321
01:48:09,07 --> 01:48:12,70
a meeting and I told them they
were foolish in doing that and

1322
01:48:12,78 --> 01:48:19,68
a few of the gentlemen here tonight
were on that committee they still voted

1323
01:48:19,69 --> 01:48:26,32
unanimously to do it. They
should get it back that

1324
01:48:26,33 --> 01:48:33,22
power belongs in their pocket they still
present their budget to you like any other

1325
01:48:33,23 --> 01:48:39,62
department in the town and then it's
talked over it's gone through the

1326
01:48:39,63 --> 01:48:44,89
advisory committee comes in that they
should do the same thing always they need

1327
01:48:44,90 --> 01:48:51,64
that control as far as giving it away to
other towns Absolutely not and you will

1328
01:48:51,65 --> 01:48:58,53
never get that passed with time and I
am sure every citizen in this town

1329
01:48:58,98 --> 01:49:04,72
would come down here and say no
when you talked about Spring Street

1330
01:49:05,93 --> 01:49:08,24
and the C.O.

1331
01:49:08,25 --> 01:49:14,65
Street going to be answerable. What
was that sewer line going down there

1332
01:49:15,98 --> 01:49:22,11
every citizen there wanted
to tie in and they couldn't

1333
01:49:24,56 --> 01:49:30,59
any sewer system that comes into this
town and it goes by a residence or

1334
01:49:30,60 --> 01:49:36,87
a business that th should be put in period
it should be put in. I don't care who's

1335
01:49:36,88 --> 01:49:43,39
paying for it I don't care if and if
development is paying for it if it goes by

1336
01:49:43,40 --> 01:49:45,31
a town home

1337
01:49:45,89 --> 01:49:52,00
a business the teacher should be put
in in case someone system fails

1338
01:49:53,42 --> 01:49:57,57
the Board of Health is going to tell
them to tie in and they should.

1339
01:50:00,63 --> 01:50:04,65
A lot of things that you have done in the
town that they people that are having the

1340
01:50:04,66 --> 01:50:11,23
sewers in when they're paying for the tell
you the truth every citizen in this town

1341
01:50:11,24 --> 01:50:17,42
should be paying for it in some
minute amount you would have

1342
01:50:17,43 --> 01:50:24,11
a system and when it goes by your street
regardless of who's putting it in you can

1343
01:50:24,12 --> 01:50:30,13
tie into it and that's how it should
be I mean in the past like I say

1344
01:50:30,97 --> 01:50:35,100
Gentlemen I'm sorry but you voted against
that and you didn't want to keep your

1345
01:50:36,01 --> 01:50:37,60
power and it was

1346
01:50:37,61 --> 01:50:44,11
a few years back I went to your meeting and
told you you were crazy please give it

1347
01:50:44,12 --> 01:50:50,14
back to them I think they can do the job
and they will include every citizen in

1348
01:50:50,15 --> 01:50:55,24
town to let them know what's going on
thank you thank you I want to make

1349
01:50:55,25 --> 01:51:02,12
a motion for Neil Kaiser for selectman.
And I can. And thank you for setting up

1350
01:51:02,13 --> 01:51:04,21
office today also cable access.

1351
01:51:12,55 --> 01:51:16,60
Did you want we just want to know it wasn't
too relevant to that other than I think

1352
01:51:16,61 --> 01:51:17,57
any time we issue

1353
01:51:17,58 --> 01:51:21,83
a sore extension permit that they require
the wiles to be stopped by the property

1354
01:51:21,84 --> 01:51:28,53
so as that. But the. District

1355
01:51:28,54 --> 01:51:29,36
agreement has

1356
01:51:29,37 --> 01:51:34,80
a provision that allows for. Sale of
capacity among the member towns if

1357
01:51:34,81 --> 01:51:36,41
a member times inclined and were

1358
01:51:36,42 --> 01:51:41,66
a little concerned about what not knowing
what the proposal would be how does that

1359
01:51:43,10 --> 01:51:47,43
comply or conflict with the terms of the
agreement so we'd have to look at that.

1360
01:51:51,49 --> 01:51:57,25
It may not but I just don't know
I just want to. Be certain.

1361
01:52:02,31 --> 01:52:06,49
Just briefly I don't want to be repetitive
because it was kind of the same circle

1362
01:52:06,50 --> 01:52:11,81
but I've been following this for what eight
or nine years even before the I mean

1363
01:52:11,82 --> 01:52:14,99
when we're talking about the critical
needs and all through that when I was an

1364
01:52:15,00 --> 01:52:19,28
advisor committee in the selectmen all
the time meetings the discussion about

1365
01:52:19,29 --> 01:52:22,33
taking big chunks and selling
it to other towns just was not

1366
01:52:22,34 --> 01:52:26,84
a discussion you know in the end rich I
understand we're kind of muddying it but

1367
01:52:26,85 --> 01:52:27,11
this is

1368
01:52:27,12 --> 01:52:32,70
a third meeting that we've had in the last
two meetings we've been giving charging

1369
01:52:32,71 --> 01:52:38,10
graphs of the different sewer rates I'm
sorry sewer allowances for different

1370
01:52:38,11 --> 01:52:42,51
properties and so we're given that
information over the last two meetings so

1371
01:52:42,63 --> 01:52:45,92
whether we wanted to or not where you
know we're in the sewer business over the

1372
01:52:45,93 --> 01:52:50,53
last couple months. I don't want to take
anyone's authority out of any other

1373
01:52:50,54 --> 01:52:56,43
elected boards or compiler or commissions
rights and powers and valves and pipes

1374
01:52:57,11 --> 01:52:59,20
however selling big chunks to

1375
01:52:59,88 --> 01:53:06,42
a different town we're kind of brought
into that because we're in somewhat

1376
01:53:06,86 --> 01:53:11,73
responsible for the economic development
in our town so we're not so when that the

1377
01:53:11,74 --> 01:53:15,47
planning board goes out and does their
exercise with master plans and invites

1378
01:53:15,48 --> 01:53:22,17
people and we've got this vision that's
growing in moving but we don't have sewer

1379
01:53:22,18 --> 01:53:26,19
for it because we needed to pay
a bill. This would have been

1380
01:53:26,51 --> 01:53:30,06
a topic of discussion at the town
meeting that we need to sell

1381
01:53:30,07 --> 01:53:32,89
a big chunk to sue or to Sharon or

1382
01:53:32,90 --> 01:53:36,73
a lot all over ever but it was just never
discussed so the reason that we're doing

1383
01:53:36,74 --> 01:53:38,66
it now is because it's come up through

1384
01:53:38,67 --> 01:53:44,30
a process so I'm often given all your power
back except if you want to sell it if

1385
01:53:44,86 --> 01:53:48,85
an entity from out of town wants to
purchase it I think it needs to be

1386
01:53:48,86 --> 01:53:52,20
a checks and balance whether it was
thought about before or not we're in the

1387
01:53:52,21 --> 01:53:56,56
situation and we were given all
this stuff and you know I did spend

1388
01:53:56,57 --> 01:54:00,92
a lot of time looking at. The analysis of
the different properties in time out and

1389
01:54:00,93 --> 01:54:05,99
who has sewer and what gallonage in some
of it just doesn't make sense and I asked

1390
01:54:06,10 --> 01:54:06,56
you know for

1391
01:54:06,57 --> 01:54:11,33
a joint meeting with the planning board
and so our commission. And that didn't

1392
01:54:11,34 --> 01:54:14,98
happen over the last couple months so I
don't have the answers to feel comfortable

1393
01:54:14,99 --> 01:54:18,45
the say take everything back
and then tomorrow there's

1394
01:54:18,46 --> 01:54:23,89
a sale to Sharon and his it ten gallons or
one hundred ten thousand gallons I don't

1395
01:54:23,90 --> 01:54:27,68
know and I'm not getting straight answers
and I said I read all the memos ever read

1396
01:54:27,69 --> 01:54:31,21
all the numbers and it's not making
any sense if you came back with

1397
01:54:31,22 --> 01:54:36,40
a program that says all right over the
next two years we've got. Thirty thousand

1398
01:54:36,41 --> 01:54:42,02
gallons extra because we've taken all the
allocated flows and adjusted but I'm not

1399
01:54:42,03 --> 01:54:48,42
seeing it and rightfully so if we're not
given that information I'm not comfortable

1400
01:54:48,43 --> 01:54:52,88
the save run with it he sell it to Sharon
because we get stuck holding the bag if

1401
01:54:52,89 --> 01:54:56,55
you can't pay the bill but the other the
water and sewer enterprise if they can see

1402
01:54:56,56 --> 01:54:59,31
the bill it falls back on the
the taxpayers because there's

1403
01:54:59,32 --> 01:55:05,02
a default and you guys own that not us but
we're here because we were asked to kind

1404
01:55:05,03 --> 01:55:06,84
of participate and it's a little bit of

1405
01:55:06,85 --> 01:55:10,80
a quagmire so you know it's probably said
five different ways to take all the power

1406
01:55:10,81 --> 01:55:14,58
back on for that but not selling
it to another town unless is

1407
01:55:14,59 --> 01:55:19,39
a well thought out plan that we can kind
of say great take it because this makes

1408
01:55:19,40 --> 01:55:25,79
sense but I don't think we're
there yet right now. I think

1409
01:55:26,76 --> 01:55:32,36
I read you had said that
we already so. It's

1410
01:55:32,45 --> 01:55:39,27
a blow to the tenets of their. President
his belief that oh that wasn't

1411
01:55:39,28 --> 01:55:44,93
a good president it's buys the votes so
concerned in the residents of bucks for oh

1412
01:55:45,28 --> 01:55:49,93
I don't know that it's a no and no but
but but yeah but I don't think that's

1413
01:55:49,94 --> 01:55:54,40
a good argument that person has been set
just because something was done one time

1414
01:55:54,81 --> 01:55:58,38
doesn't mean it was good for the town but
you know I don't think it was good for

1415
01:55:58,39 --> 01:56:02,70
the town but folks and you can ask anybody
on Wall Street or the other street loved

1416
01:56:03,03 --> 01:56:06,32
this think it was good but. GORDON.

1417
01:56:10,69 --> 01:56:15,72
Gordon grain I think that this is

1418
01:56:15,73 --> 01:56:22,57
a discussion that probably should have
been How'd. Six months ago it's not

1419
01:56:22,58 --> 01:56:25,42
a discussion for a month before

1420
01:56:25,43 --> 01:56:32,19
a town meeting it's my opinion that it
does I don't quote go to the floor of

1421
01:56:32,20 --> 01:56:38,31
time meeting it would be defeated but it's
an article that needs to be addressed I

1422
01:56:38,32 --> 01:56:45,17
believe that the town watch to keep
the authority for some water and so

1423
01:56:45,45 --> 01:56:51,07
with water and sewer The only issue that
comes up is just going out of town the

1424
01:56:51,08 --> 01:56:57,94
vote the town meeting previously had and I
would strongly recommend that you advise

1425
01:56:57,94 --> 01:57:04,82
. That water and sewer withdraw
the article and hold it until the

1426
01:57:04,83 --> 01:57:10,53
special town meeting in September and get
dusting resolved so we can all go to town

1427
01:57:10,54 --> 01:57:15,81
meeting in lockstep Thank you.

1428
01:57:22,13 --> 01:57:28,96
Thank you yes thank you David OK I think
I think all these discussions have

1429
01:57:28,97 --> 01:57:29,38
brought up

1430
01:57:30,08 --> 01:57:36,97
a very curious point and that is excess
capacity is access capacity really an

1431
01:57:36,98 --> 01:57:40,48
asset is an asset if you don't
have the infrastructure to have

1432
01:57:40,49 --> 01:57:46,34
a flow do we have the infrastructure in
place to flow what our capacity is today.

1433
01:57:47,54 --> 01:57:52,30
And we have infrastructure in place to
flow future capacity excess capacity we

1434
01:57:52,31 --> 01:57:58,81
don't know that we have
we have we have. Charts

1435
01:57:59,04 --> 01:58:04,35
and excess capacity and what what we
expect to be excess capacity but how we're

1436
01:58:04,36 --> 01:58:05,84
going to get from point A to Point B.

1437
01:58:06,65 --> 01:58:13,19
Answers. Or Street. Has money

1438
01:58:13,37 --> 01:58:20,33
Basset. Hounds get back to you that
you think those days. The more

1439
01:58:20,34 --> 01:58:26,75
street quite as plenty of capacity because
none of the capacity that was allocated

1440
01:58:26,76 --> 01:58:33,33
for that line and had to be examined at
that time was never sold so that we get

1441
01:58:33,34 --> 01:58:36,61
seventy two thousand gallons sitting up
at the end of that that's not coming

1442
01:58:36,62 --> 01:58:42,95
through the pipe right now that's the way
it is the town's. Capacity that is the

1443
01:58:43,13 --> 01:58:48,12
that the towns area around the common and
and all the way down county street you

1444
01:58:48,13 --> 01:58:52,23
know with all the other entity is that we
have on sort of with the exception of C.

1445
01:58:52,24 --> 01:58:58,82
Is the states in green view is overcapacity
right now but it's primarily because of

1446
01:58:58,83 --> 01:59:05,27
inflow and infiltration I'm
speaking to this you all happen

1447
01:59:05,69 --> 01:59:11,01
but what that does is that pays off the
plant. Unfortunately the sewer enterprise

1448
01:59:11,02 --> 01:59:16,32
account does not have enough money for us
that even if we discover through an I and

1449
01:59:16,33 --> 01:59:20,75
I that we've got problems in the common
area we can't fix it because we don't have

1450
01:59:20,76 --> 01:59:27,38
the cash to do it and. Merely doing
this does not bring anything into that

1451
01:59:27,77 --> 01:59:32,40
enterprise account that allows us to do
things like that to fix problems in the

1452
01:59:32,41 --> 01:59:39,34
system or to address new new entities
for example you know we said that

1453
01:59:39,57 --> 01:59:43,64
these entities that come in that are big
commercial I think he's need to provide

1454
01:59:43,65 --> 01:59:48,16
their own infrastructure because we don't
have the means to do it and if they

1455
01:59:48,17 --> 01:59:52,96
provide their own infrastructure and you
know pay for them for that the gallons per

1456
01:59:52,97 --> 01:59:57,89
day they can get into the system so the
answer is part of our system has available

1457
01:59:57,90 --> 02:00:02,51
capacity to transport sewer to
Mansfield and to the plant part of

1458
02:00:02,52 --> 02:00:07,52
a thousand that's it and we still have the
issue with the master plan with some of

1459
02:00:07,53 --> 02:00:13,99
those other economic development areas
getting flow across town so I think there's

1460
02:00:14,00 --> 02:00:14,61
a there's

1461
02:00:14,62 --> 02:00:20,01
a bigger discussion that needs to happen
specifically with silica pasty and what is

1462
02:00:20,02 --> 02:00:26,82
capacity. I think. Gordon
might be correct you know. We

1463
02:00:26,83 --> 02:00:27,42
come up with

1464
02:00:27,73 --> 02:00:34,37
a war Arkell the pulls out the sale
of capacity to. Outside our borders

1465
02:00:34,57 --> 02:00:39,68
Well we table until the fall thinking.

1466
02:00:42,99 --> 02:00:45,28
It would the Board of Selectmen entertain

1467
02:00:45,35 --> 02:00:51,07
a joint committee between water and sewer
in the selectmen with equal votes to deal

1468
02:00:51,08 --> 02:00:57,99
with this one issue and then clean up the
water an article to deal with everything

1469
02:00:58,00 --> 02:01:03,30
else. From a town meeting. From

1470
02:01:03,31 --> 02:01:09,81
a town meeting I suggested How about I
mean if you if you say table this still.

1471
02:01:11,14 --> 02:01:16,95
Yes actually I think we're getting somewhere
now to to cover the town to carve out

1472
02:01:16,96 --> 02:01:21,66
the know that these two committees would
get together and mutually decide if that

1473
02:01:21,67 --> 02:01:21,77
was

1474
02:01:21,78 --> 02:01:26,14
a good idea is two committees would take
equal number of members and put them on

1475
02:01:26,15 --> 02:01:29,28
a joint committee that would meet
solely for the purpose of the L.

1476
02:01:29,29 --> 02:01:34,43
And I think that's where the weapon began
this discussion it's getting somewhere.

1477
02:01:36,22 --> 02:01:40,18
Otherwise I'd work if I'm wrong because if
we table the Senate doesn't do anything

1478
02:01:40,19 --> 02:01:44,17
in town meeting with you guys and we still
mission I think everybody the people who

1479
02:01:44,18 --> 02:01:48,44
voted for what reason if we don't
want to be addressed in the form of

1480
02:01:48,45 --> 02:01:53,88
a floor Amendment right away which to the
existing war I don't recall establishing

1481
02:01:53,98 --> 02:01:59,63
a joint committee but. You know look we
dressed the article says he was Chancellor

1482
02:01:59,64 --> 02:02:06,01
of the new school there without me. I'm
sorry go ahead I'm sorry I was going to

1483
02:02:06,74 --> 02:02:12,75
repeat the question please so I thought
the question was Should we move to amend

1484
02:02:12,76 --> 02:02:16,36
the motion to include the joint committee
to address that but the one articles

1485
02:02:16,37 --> 02:02:19,86
about authorization for such
legislation so I think you can do

1486
02:02:19,87 --> 02:02:25,37
a joint committee. On your own at Town
Council agrees but like you don't need it I

1487
02:02:25,38 --> 02:02:27,05
mean vote to establish

1488
02:02:27,43 --> 02:02:32,98
a joint committee to study this issue and
see if you can come to terms. Right that

1489
02:02:32,99 --> 02:02:36,94
might be slightly outside the scope of the
article in the warrants already closed

1490
02:02:36,95 --> 02:02:38,70
so it's possible we could have

1491
02:02:39,22 --> 02:02:45,45
a motion from town meeting for that does
something with respect to the authority

1492
02:02:45,56 --> 02:02:49,01
part of it but we can't create a
separate committee and I think that's

1493
02:02:49,02 --> 02:02:50,90
a good idea it sounds like
that's getting towards

1494
02:02:50,91 --> 02:02:54,68
a solution but I don't think it would be
within the scope of the war in article to

1495
02:02:54,69 --> 02:03:00,35
make that change separately it may be
possible that we. Without the town meeting

1496
02:03:00,84 --> 02:03:06,61
create an ad hoc committee and and then
give it. However many you know if you want

1497
02:03:06,75 --> 02:03:10,04
all eight of you five so on the three
of you if you just want to take

1498
02:03:10,05 --> 02:03:14,94
a majority of each of those members on
then have equal approval farty if that's

1499
02:03:14,95 --> 02:03:19,36
something you all agree on there's a way
we can make that work can I just ask

1500
02:03:19,37 --> 02:03:26,26
a question the the urgency between
rushing it and getting it on May first

1501
02:03:26,27 --> 02:03:27,69
extending it to have it on

1502
02:03:27,70 --> 02:03:32,70
a. Special time meeting and I'm missing
something is our contract waiting to be

1503
02:03:32,71 --> 02:03:37,83
signed that we had those extra months we've
been given the opinion that anything we

1504
02:03:37,84 --> 02:03:41,51
do or act on as one of those will
commissioners could be in question so you're

1505
02:03:41,52 --> 02:03:44,62
That's what I understand that's what I'm
saying are you guys working on something

1506
02:03:44,98 --> 02:03:46,98
that is going to be a
question that can't wait

1507
02:03:46,99 --> 02:03:53,79
a few months and anything we vote
on from an abatement to. Meat

1508
02:03:53,80 --> 02:03:59,26
meaning man and song essentially could be
brought into question so that's OK. If I

1509
02:03:59,27 --> 02:04:03,31
could for you just I think it's important
you do before in the article or sooner

1510
02:04:03,32 --> 02:04:07,95
rather than later for all the things that
we just talked about but it's and to I

1511
02:04:07,96 --> 02:04:12,24
think it's possible that I'll defer to
counsel on this that this part of the motion

1512
02:04:13,16 --> 02:04:18,18
what's good said is that is that the
that the that they move to approve the

1513
02:04:18,19 --> 02:04:25,15
authority as stated in the in the to two
thousand the Act of two thousand and ten

1514
02:04:25,62 --> 02:04:32,25
two thousand and six. Is that correct
Steve yes and in that with the

1515
02:04:32,26 --> 02:04:39,19
exception that any sale capacity outside
the borders would be subject to further

1516
02:04:39,20 --> 02:04:39,76
review by

1517
02:04:39,77 --> 02:04:44,60
a joint committee joint committee so you
single you can carve that topic out of

1518
02:04:44,61 --> 02:04:49,10
that motion here because right now the at
the current the current authority gives

1519
02:04:49,44 --> 02:04:54,40
gives the commission the entire three
thought over all sales. Capacity that's the

1520
02:04:54,41 --> 02:04:59,94
issue right now but the powers can go back
to the commission but you're just going

1521
02:04:59,95 --> 02:05:04,33
to carve out that once I want the one
topic is that possible to do that I don't

1522
02:05:04,34 --> 02:05:04,85
know they are not I'm

1523
02:05:04,86 --> 02:05:09,04
a logical perspective you're going to be
on legal fees which I don't know I don't

1524
02:05:09,05 --> 02:05:13,23
know if I heard exactly what that language
would be like if you could be that for

1525
02:05:13,24 --> 02:05:17,99
local approval for legislation if there's
some uncertainty in it and then we dance

1526
02:05:18,00 --> 02:05:20,64
that to the legislature
would they accept it as

1527
02:05:20,65 --> 02:05:27,38
a local approval or town meeting depends
on what your language was. That might make

1528
02:05:27,39 --> 02:05:30,26
it so I suspect if if it
said it's something to be

1529
02:05:30,31 --> 02:05:35,52
a player to be named later and then we do
that no legislation Council at the house

1530
02:05:35,53 --> 02:05:40,22
might say right that's not my approval and
I don't know that's just I think what I

1531
02:05:40,23 --> 02:05:46,88
was suggesting is that the motion at our
meeting on the article would be that that

1532
02:05:46,89 --> 02:05:53,13
it be be approved be so approved with the
exception of any sale of capacity outside

1533
02:05:53,14 --> 02:05:55,66
the time so a capacity
as i shall we say with

1534
02:05:55,67 --> 02:06:01,90
a further review. By by by special commission
Oh I think it's not adding that to

1535
02:06:01,91 --> 02:06:05,56
the actual you know more about it right
but just by the motion and I think

1536
02:06:05,57 --> 02:06:09,64
impending on the final language which I
know I gave you I wore an article we then

1537
02:06:09,65 --> 02:06:10,08
tweeted

1538
02:06:10,09 --> 02:06:13,74
a little bit further I haven't seen
whatever you've finally got on the war it's

1539
02:06:13,75 --> 02:06:19,26
a Depending on what the languages you can
make the motion narrower to be something

1540
02:06:19,27 --> 02:06:25,61
within the article and you can't explain
you can't broaden it at all and make

1541
02:06:25,62 --> 02:06:28,95
something more specific with respect to
another committee or whatever the approval

1542
02:06:28,96 --> 02:06:31,31
it already is going to
be but you can eliminate

1543
02:06:31,40 --> 02:06:37,95
a small portion of what's in there.
Like you think you get. The ones.

1544
02:06:39,21 --> 02:06:39,45
And

1545
02:06:39,49 --> 02:06:44,34
a warning of your create you know I gave
it to the slide thank you right you know

1546
02:06:44,35 --> 02:06:49,50
it was it was there with the other meetings
ago with two means ago you know what

1547
02:06:49,51 --> 02:06:56,42
you want to read you want to.
Hear it yeah. That's OK but

1548
02:06:56,43 --> 02:07:01,31
I can really play so that it says that the
to authorize the war to select in the

1549
02:07:01,32 --> 02:07:02,45
fall of the General Court

1550
02:07:02,46 --> 02:07:06,77
a petition for specialist lation to clarify
the executive powers of the town's

1551
02:07:06,78 --> 02:07:10,60
water and sewer commission is by amending
Chapter five the exit two thousand and

1552
02:07:10,61 --> 02:07:14,79
four entitled An act providing
for a select when Tommy to form

1553
02:07:14,80 --> 02:07:19,04
a government in the town Fox rubber
revising Section three subparts

1554
02:07:19,08 --> 02:07:25,69
a set out to read as follows new text is
on the line. He says Section three A He's

1555
02:07:25,70 --> 02:07:25,86
actually

1556
02:07:25,87 --> 02:07:30,05
a positon should be vested in the board
of selectmen in the act referred to as is

1557
02:07:30,06 --> 02:07:34,79
the B.O.'s who shall have all the powers
given in the boards of the selectmen by

1558
02:07:34,80 --> 02:07:38,97
general laws except for those executive
powers granted to time engine except for

1559
02:07:38,98 --> 02:07:42,20
those executive powers granted
to the town's board of water so

1560
02:07:42,21 --> 02:07:46,19
a commission has by chapter forty six of
the acts apply to this I were provided

1561
02:07:47,08 --> 02:07:50,59
provided however that all personal collective
bargaining powers of the Waters who

1562
02:07:50,60 --> 02:07:57,24
commissioners shall be vested in the tell
me that there was something new. And

1563
02:07:57,25 --> 02:08:03,08
provided for there however the voices like
mentioned have final authority over any

1564
02:08:03,09 --> 02:08:06,72
sales to it because of the that was the
thing that we talked about the way they

1565
02:08:06,73 --> 02:08:11,98
mean to property and that's where we treat
their living for there are so property

1566
02:08:12,03 --> 02:08:18,52
outside of town borders so very. So that
was the article that I provided and my

1567
02:08:18,53 --> 02:08:22,41
understanding was that only these are part
of it for the from the perspective of

1568
02:08:22,42 --> 02:08:27,33
the wire in circulation degraded want to
get that so instead of the word final

1569
02:08:27,33 --> 02:08:34,26
should have the joint. But if this is
what you put on the warrant then that

1570
02:08:34,62 --> 02:08:39,20
line which I gave to you from what has it
in his No one has an agenda you know this

1571
02:08:39,21 --> 02:08:43,33
is not this is not been we haven't actually
filed the war yeah I mean it's been

1572
02:08:43,34 --> 02:08:46,98
votes and shared with everybody right
everybody's every read it but this is the

1573
02:08:46,99 --> 02:08:51,42
article that's in there now so we haven't
changed anything that's been filed as

1574
02:08:51,46 --> 02:08:56,94
soon as they submitted. So the question
is can we can we send them or not and can

1575
02:08:56,95 --> 02:08:58,24
we put together a warrant

1576
02:08:58,73 --> 02:09:03,98
a motion that will address
this issue. There's

1577
02:09:03,99 --> 02:09:08,90
a possible you know I'm the only mechanism
to do that is on the floor. If the

1578
02:09:08,91 --> 02:09:12,43
moderator declares it within the scope of
the article but I had understood that you

1579
02:09:12,44 --> 02:09:16,70
were going to include that extra provision
that I provided about with that other

1580
02:09:16,71 --> 02:09:20,59
exception that you don't don't have to
be another motion on the floor of the

1581
02:09:20,60 --> 02:09:25,24
meeting to that language reality and they're
going to get enough of that to get you

1582
02:09:25,25 --> 02:09:30,14
know that you're right so it was corrected
for later i guess if the moderator says

1583
02:09:30,15 --> 02:09:35,47
it's within the scope of the article.
Which I wrote in my opinion it could be

1584
02:09:35,48 --> 02:09:38,72
considered to be within the scope because
it's one exception to the power that

1585
02:09:38,73 --> 02:09:42,25
you're getting back to that right now that
the paralyzed from the selectmen whether

1586
02:09:42,26 --> 02:09:46,05
that was intended or not that's where this
and so the article the purpose of the

1587
02:09:46,06 --> 02:09:50,65
article was to try to give the power back
to the water and sewer commission. With

1588
02:09:51,44 --> 02:09:56,04
those two exceptions the one that's in there
and then the additional one regarding

1589
02:09:56,05 --> 02:10:01,04
the sale of capacity outside of town since
that one didn't make it in there in my

1590
02:10:01,05 --> 02:10:05,60
opinion that would be within the scope
because the scope was broader but that would

1591
02:10:05,61 --> 02:10:05,70
be

1592
02:10:05,71 --> 02:10:16,29
a call for the moderator over. The
top about his decision. Which

1593
02:10:16,30 --> 02:10:23,29
would I'm sorry but what do you think
of that language he added language you

1594
02:10:23,30 --> 02:10:30,18
know. It ends up and. It ends up
being those two exceptions it's the

1595
02:10:30,19 --> 02:10:33,58
employees and then a joint decision

1596
02:10:34,31 --> 02:10:39,84
a joint authority I think it if it's joint.
And we agree to it if if it's sold to

1597
02:10:39,85 --> 02:10:46,70
the. Selectmen then that's what we
initially had an issue with. I think the

1598
02:10:46,71 --> 02:10:47,56
intention is to have

1599
02:10:47,57 --> 02:10:52,44
a joint correct. But I'd also say
whatever how whatever is the cleanest

1600
02:10:52,66 --> 02:10:56,65
presentation of it I think is the way
should be read be right we're all going for

1601
02:10:56,66 --> 02:10:59,34
a yes I think we can work on

1602
02:10:59,35 --> 02:11:04,26
a motion for that that we can both review
it with everybody the last thing we want

1603
02:11:04,27 --> 02:11:09,54
to end up what is sitting here. Two months
two years from now exact mind out that

1604
02:11:09,55 --> 02:11:11,37
it could be construed in

1605
02:11:11,42 --> 02:11:17,09
a way that it wasn't represented to be and
we want to we we clearly want to make

1606
02:11:17,10 --> 02:11:21,63
sure that the language is clear his is
appropriate but I would also like to say

1607
02:11:21,91 --> 02:11:27,92
that language is. Standard language isn't
there I would like to have the Board of

1608
02:11:27,93 --> 02:11:34,48
Water storage approve it and
if somebody at town meetings

1609
02:11:34,81 --> 02:11:39,34
because I was not like to
see Sunday morning so it's

1610
02:11:39,35 --> 02:11:43,31
a you know we should we should not we're
not going to support this and then that.

1611
02:11:47,90 --> 02:11:52,78
And I think we're given every indication
we support that's what I hope so. We

1612
02:11:52,79 --> 02:11:58,80
proposed because the crisis out of
that I do not think you can you read

1613
02:11:58,81 --> 02:12:05,15
a piece of well I can you know I just
I just made a note to myself to draft

1614
02:12:05,16 --> 02:12:12,05
a motion under. So it will be.
Starting back from the very beginning

1615
02:12:12,93 --> 02:12:16,09
I move that we are after is the border
slot going to file the General Court

1616
02:12:16,10 --> 02:12:19,36
a petition for special interest lation
to clarify the executive powers of the

1617
02:12:19,37 --> 02:12:21,47
town's water and sewer Commissioners by

1618
02:12:21,48 --> 02:12:25,05
a man in chapter five of the acts of
two thousand and four entitled An act

1619
02:12:25,06 --> 02:12:25,75
providing for

1620
02:12:25,76 --> 02:12:30,35
a selectman had been town manager form of
government in the town of Foxborough very

1621
02:12:30,36 --> 02:12:34,74
much as in section three sub part of said
Act read as follows in the new Texas

1622
02:12:34,75 --> 02:12:39,40
underline Section three A executive powers
of the town to be vested in the board of

1623
02:12:39,41 --> 02:12:44,85
selectmen in this act referred to as Board
of Selectmen for outside below us who

1624
02:12:44,86 --> 02:12:49,09
shall have all the powers given to boards
of slope and by the general laws except

1625
02:12:49,13 --> 02:12:53,09
for those executive powers granted to
the town manager and except for those

1626
02:12:53,10 --> 02:12:58,01
executive powers granted to the boards
I'm sorry the town's Board of Water and

1627
02:12:58,06 --> 02:13:02,49
Sewer Commissioners by chapter forty six
of the Acts of one nine hundred eighty six

1628
02:13:03,01 --> 02:13:09,32
and provided further however. That all
personal and collective bargaining powers of

1629
02:13:09,33 --> 02:13:14,24
the town and sewer commissioner shall be
vested with the town manager and this is

1630
02:13:14,25 --> 02:13:20,58
where and they play messy notes
provided further however that. All

1631
02:13:21,88 --> 02:13:27,74
sale of water and sewer capacity outside
of town shall be subject to joint approval

1632
02:13:28,09 --> 02:13:33,14
of the board of selectmen and water and
sewer commission. And I don't think you'd

1633
02:13:33,15 --> 02:13:39,34
want water power here just. To

1634
02:13:39,35 --> 02:13:45,92
a private party would you. That's what
I would say because you know you have

1635
02:13:46,85 --> 02:13:51,24
a whole series of those at the minute if
the talent Sharon is purchasing it for

1636
02:13:51,25 --> 02:13:56,32
their private development. Why wouldn't why
would you want to put private I want to

1637
02:13:56,33 --> 02:14:02,05
begin to. Sell it to Mansfield
feeling nor to you just so.

1638
02:14:04,20 --> 02:14:08,77
They could be sold to share.
With you believe it is.

1639
02:14:14,96 --> 02:14:19,09
Linda thanks Linda was a planned out. Just

1640
02:14:19,10 --> 02:14:22,57
a quick question I think of that he
answered but I just want to clarify

1641
02:14:23,26 --> 02:14:26,43
a couple weeks ago when we having this
discussion you folks are having this

1642
02:14:26,47 --> 02:14:33,29
discussion it came up about the
board is like men having. A say

1643
02:14:33,30 --> 02:14:40,09
in the billboards funding and everything
and revenue that's gone away then that's

1644
02:14:40,10 --> 02:14:45,04
back to the water and so are correct
there was always with it was

1645
02:14:45,05 --> 02:14:47,50
a mission there was always
with right but you had made

1646
02:14:47,51 --> 02:14:53,99
a comment about no no I think the clarify
that I'd say only that we've had some

1647
02:14:54,15 --> 02:14:59,29
discussions about the possible possibility
we're not it's not just with this board

1648
02:14:59,30 --> 02:15:01,11
though we've been talking
I was talking with

1649
02:15:01,12 --> 02:15:06,75
a water so commission that Lorraine did
make and that your comment you're referring

1650
02:15:06,76 --> 02:15:13,13
to my comment about the water tower Yes
that's not part of this discussion. Not

1651
02:15:13,14 --> 02:15:17,47
part of this discussion and won't be part
of this article either you know not to

1652
02:15:17,48 --> 02:15:20,29
the water and so are crap it was always
with water and you're right it was.

1653
02:15:25,77 --> 02:15:32,05
So high street the town councils original
amendment to the warrant was all sale of

1654
02:15:32,06 --> 02:15:39,05
sewer. And then you just add it outside
of town. So where does that leave us

1655
02:15:39,68 --> 02:15:45,18
in terms of outside of the sewer district
sales of sewer capacity outside of the

1656
02:15:45,19 --> 02:15:49,46
sewer district that there remains
unchanged Earth or is the same as it was

1657
02:15:49,47 --> 02:15:54,84
a car is always was so that authority is
as it will go back to the saw with this

1658
02:15:54,85 --> 02:15:59,52
remember it will go back to this water sewer
commission I believe the select woman

1659
02:15:59,53 --> 02:16:03,71
said that at the Town Meeting understanding
was that sale outside of the sewer

1660
02:16:03,72 --> 02:16:07,36
district had to be approved by town meeting
still that's correct that's things that

1661
02:16:07,37 --> 02:16:11,97
will still sponsor Thank you. Tracey.

1662
02:16:14,45 --> 02:16:18,26
Tracey the silly chair the advisory
committee we are having our last meeting

1663
02:16:18,27 --> 02:16:22,62
tomorrow which I know all you where because
I think I've met with you all many

1664
02:16:22,63 --> 02:16:27,09
times over the past couple weeks so we're
going to need this wording just from

1665
02:16:27,10 --> 02:16:32,35
a timing perspective you know the expectation
to that it and to vote on it in one

1666
02:16:32,36 --> 02:16:34,99
evening is it's going to be
kind of difficult you've got

1667
02:16:35,00 --> 02:16:39,38
a couple of topics we need to discuss
tomorrow so I just want to put it out there

1668
02:16:39,39 --> 02:16:43,19
that we're up against crunch time we've
also got to get things to the paper in the

1669
02:16:43,20 --> 02:16:46,92
write ups done so if you can just be aware
that I know we're twenty four hours away

1670
02:16:46,99 --> 02:16:52,98
but we are dealing with some tough time
things from stinking thinking so I'm

1671
02:16:53,81 --> 02:16:56,81
rich can we. Come to

1672
02:16:56,82 --> 02:16:59,91
a consensus here that this is the
language will bring forward we'll have

1673
02:16:59,92 --> 02:17:05,62
a typed and ready for advisory committee
tomorrow and we can all agree that we

1674
02:17:05,63 --> 02:17:12,14
support this. Larry. And somebody will get
it over to the moderator because I think

1675
02:17:12,15 --> 02:17:16,42
he's got to he has to be going to us
before they can yes he'll come you know it

1676
02:17:16,43 --> 02:17:20,84
took us through what's your thought and.
So what we're going to need tonight yes

1677
02:17:21,39 --> 02:17:25,87
Bill do you think we should take any type
of vote on this. I think that they this

1678
02:17:25,88 --> 02:17:26,20
should be

1679
02:17:26,21 --> 02:17:31,71
a vote on both from both wars that will
support the language as discussed and I can

1680
02:17:31,84 --> 02:17:36,09
remember as this goes through I.
Think John you will make most of.

1681
02:17:39,73 --> 02:17:45,82
It's what article is this it's. About twenty
five OK I move the ball select accept

I know why they might write you know that

1690
02:18:42,36 --> 02:18:48,89
I'm not. For that too so that was the
provided they're. Provided further

1691
02:18:48,90 --> 02:18:53,80
however that any sale of sewer capacity
outside of town shall be subject to the

1692
02:18:53,81 --> 02:18:59,69

and water and sewer commission. To so will
