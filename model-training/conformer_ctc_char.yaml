# It contains the default values for training a Conformer-CTC ASR model, large size (~120M) with CTC loss and char-based vocabulary.
# Char-based encoding may give lower accuracy than sub-word encoding (conformer_ctc_bpe.yaml).

# You may find more detail on Conformer-CTC at `examples/asr/conf/conformer/conformer_ctc_bpe.yaml`
